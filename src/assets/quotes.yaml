        “I DON’T SEE THE POINT, the stranger said.

        “Sorry?”

        WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN?

        “How many drinks have you had?”

        FORTY-SEVEN.

        “Just about anything, then,” said the barman

        “This is Ankh-Morpork,” he said. “Anyone ought to be able to see that. Smell it, too.”

        Mort sniffed. There was a certain something about the air in the city. You got the feeling that it was air that had seen life. You couldn’t help noting with every breath that thousands of other people were very close to you and nearly all of them had armpits.

          “Er, excuse me,” said Cutwell, holding his hat respectfully, Mexican fashion.

          WELL? said Death, distracted.

          “It isn’t, sir. You must be thinking about another face.”

          WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

          “Cutwell, sir. I’m a wizard, sir.”

          I’M A WIZARD, SIR, Death sneered. BE SILENT, WIZARD.

          “Sir.” Cutwell stepped back.

          Death turned to Ysabell.

          DAUGHTER, EXPLAIN YOURSELF. WHY DID YOU AID THIS FOOL?

          Ysabell curtsied nervously.

          “I—love him, Father. I think.”

          “You do?” said Mort, astonished. “You never said!”

          “There didn’t seem to be time,” said Ysabell. “Father, he didn’t mean—”

          BE SILENT.

          Ysabell dropped her gaze. “Yes, Father.”

          Death stalked around the desk until he was standing directly in front of Mort. He stared at him for a long time.

          Then in one blurred movement his hand struck Mort across the face, knocking him off his feet.

          I INVITE YOU INTO MY HOME, he Said, I TRAIN YOU, I FEED YOU, I CLOTHE YOU, I GIVE YOU OPPORTUNITIES YOU COULD NOT DREAM OF, AND THUS YOU REPAY ME. YOU SEDUCE MY DAUGHTER FROM ME, YOU NEGLECT THE DUTY, YOU MAKE RIPPLES IN REALITY THAT WILL TAKE A CENTURY TO HEAL. YOUR ILL-TIMED ACTIONS HAVE DOOMED YOUR COMRADES TO OBLIVION. THE GODS WILL DEMAND NOTHING LESS.

          ALL IN ALL, BOY, **NOT A GOOD START TO YOUR FIRST JOB.**

        Rincewind pulled off his hat. It was battered, stained and covered with rock dust, bits of it had been sheared off, the point was dented and the star was shedding sequins like pollen, but the word ‘Wizzard’ was still just readable under the grime.

        “See this?” he demanded, red in the face. “Do you see it? Do you? What does it tell you?”

        “That you can’t spell?” said Nijel.

        “Your people are pretty rich, then?” said Chidder, ambling along beside him.

        Teppic thought about this. “No, not really,” he said. “They mainly grow melons and garlic and that kind of thing. And stand in the streets and shout ‘hurrah.’”

        “This is your parents you’re talking about?” said Chidder, puzzled.

        “Oh, them? No, my father’s a pharaoh. My mother was a concubine, I think.”

        “I thought that was some sort of vegetable.”

        “I don’t think so. We’ve never really discussed it. Anyway, she died when I was young.”

        “How dreadful,” said Chidder cheerfully.

        “She went for a moonlight swim in what turned out to be a crocodile.” Teppic tried politely not to be hurt at the boy’s reaction.

        “Our stars are entwined,” said Casanunda. “We’re fated for one another. I wants your body, Mrs. Ogg.”

        “I’m still using it.”

        And while she suspected, quite accurately, that this was an approach **the world’s second greatest lover** used on anything that appeared to be even vaguely female, Nanny Ogg had to admit that she was flattered.

    Small gods:

        “Philosophers have right of way,” said the soldier.

        “What’s a philosopher?” said Brutha.

        “Someone who’s bright enough to find a job with no heavy lifting,” said a voice in his head.

          Finally, Cuddy said: “I just want you to know that I don’t like being teamed up with you any more than you like being teamed up with me.”

          “Right!”

          “But if we’re going to have to make the best of it, there’d better be some changes, OK?”

          “Like what?”

          “Like it’s ridiculous you not even being able to count. I know trolls can count. Why can’t you?”

          “Can count!”

          “How many fingers am I holding up, then?”

          Detritus squinted.

          “Two?”

          “OK. Now how many fingers am I holding up?”

          “Two…and one more…”

          “So two and one more is…?”

          Detritus looked panicky. This was calculus territory.

          “Two and one more is three.”

          “Two and one more is three.”

          “Now how many?”

          “Two and two.”

          “That’s four.”

          “Four-er.”

          “Now how many?”

          Cuddy tried eight fingers.

          “A twofour.”

          Cuddy looked surprised. He’d expected “many”, or possibly “lots”.

          “What’s a twofour?”

          “A two and a two and a two and a two.”

          Cuddy put his head on one side.

          “Hmm,” he said. “OK. A twofour is what we call an eight.”

          “Ate.”

          “You know,” said Cuddy, subjecting the troll to a long critical stare, “you might not be as stupid as you look. This is not hard. Let’s think about this. I mean…I’ll think about this, and you can join in when you know the words.”

          Anyone strolling along Phedre Road might have seen a troll and a dwarf apparently shouting at one another in excitement.

          “A two-thirtytwo, and eight, and a one!”

          “See? How many bricks in that pile?”

          Pause.

          “A sixteen, an eight, a four, a one!”

          “Remember what I said about dividing by eight-and-two?”

          Longer pause.

          “Two-enty-nine…?”

          “Right!”

          “Right!”

          “You can get there!”

          “I can get there!”

          “You’re a natural at counting to two!”

          “I’m a nat’ral at counting to two!”

          “If you can count to two, you can count to anything!”

          “If I can count to two, I can count to anything!”

          “And then the world is your mollusc!”

          “My mollusc! What’s a mollusc?”

          Cuddy opened his eyes.

          “You’re alive?” said Detritus.

          The dwarf gingerly removed his helmet. There was a gouge in the rim, and his head ached.

          “It looks like a mild skin abrasion,” said Detritus.

          “A what? Ooooh.” Cuddy grimaced. “What about you, anyway?” he said. There was something odd about the troll. It hadn’t quite dawned on him what it was, but there was definitely something unfamiliar, quite apart from all the holes.

          “I suppose the armor was some help,” said Detritus. He pulled at the straps of his breastplate. Five discs of metal slid out at around belt level. “If it hadn’t slowed them down I’d be seriously abraded.”

          “What’s up with you? Why are you talking like that?”

          “Like what, pray?”

          “What happened to the ‘me big troll’ talk? No offense meant.”

          “I’m not sure I understand.”

          Cuddy shivered, and stamped his feet to keep warm.

          “Let’s get out of here.”

          They trotted to the door. It was shut fast.

          “Can you knock it down?”

          “No. If this place wasn’t troll proof, it’d be empty. Sorry.”

          “Detritus?”

          “Yes?”

          “Are you all right? Only there’s steam coming off your head.”

          “I do feel…er…”

          Detritus blinked. There was a tinkle of falling ice. Odd things were happening in his skull.

          Thoughts that normally ambulated sluggishly around his brain were suddenly springing into vibrant, coruscating life. And there seemed to be more and more of them.

          “My goodness,” he said, to no one in particular.

          This was a sufficiently un-troll-like comment that even Cuddy, whose extremities were already going numb, stared at him.

          “I do believe,” said Detritus, “that I am genuinely cogitating. How very interesting!”

          “What do you mean?”

          More ice cascaded off Detritus as he rubbed his head.

          “Of course!” he said, holding up a giant finger. “Superconductivity!”

          “Wha’?”

          “You see? Brain of impure silicon. Problem of heat dissipation. Daytime temperature too hot, processing speed slows down, weather gets hotter, brain stops completely, trolls turn to stone until nightfall, ie, coldertemperature, however, lowertemperature-enough, brainoperates faster and—”

          “I think I’m going to freeze to death soon,” said Cuddy.

          Detritus looked around.

          “There are small glazed apertures up there,” he said.

          “Too hi’ to rea’, e’en if I st’ on y’shoulders,” mumbled Cuddy, slumping down further.

          “Ah, but my plan involves throwing something through them to attract help,” said Detritus.

          “Wha’ pla’?”

          “I have in fact eventuated twenty-three but this one has a ninety-seven percent chance of success,” said Detritus, beaming.

          “Ha’nt got an’ting t’throw,” said Cuddy.

          “I have,” said Detritus, scooping him up. “Do not worry. I can compute your trajectory with astonishing precision. And then all you will need to do is fetch Captain Vimes or Carrot or someone.”

          Cuddy’s feeble protests described an arc through the freezing air and vanished along with the window glass.

          Detritus sat down again. Life was so simple, when you really thought about it. And he was really thinking.

          He was seventy-six percent sure he was going to get at least seven degrees colder.

        quote: |
          Detritus sat and steamed. Now he felt hungry—not for food, but for things to think about. As the temperature sank, the efficiency of his brain increased even more. It needed something to do.

          He calculated the number of bricks in the wall, first in twos and then in tens and finally in sixteens. The numbers formed up and marched past his brain in terrified obedience. Division and multiplication were discovered. Algebra was invented and provided an interesting diversion for a minute or two. And then he felt the fog of numbers drift away, and looked up and saw the sparkling, distant mountains of calculus.

          Trolls evolved in high, rocky and above all in cold places. Their silicon brains were used to operating at low temperatures. But down on the muggy plains the heat build-up slowed them down and made them dull. It wasn’t that only stupid trolls came down to the city. Trolls who decided to come down to the city were often quite smart—but they became stupid.

          Detritus was considered moronic even by city troll standards. But that was simply because his brain was naturally optimized for a temperature seldom reached in Ankh-Morpork even during the coldest winter…

          Now his brain was nearing its ideal temperature of operation. Unfortunately, this was pretty close to a troll’s optimum point of death.

          Part of his brain gave some thought to this. There was a high probability of rescue. That meant he’d have to leave. That meant he’d become stupid again, as sure as 

          10^3 (M_c / M_p)alpha^sigma alpha^G -1/2N = 10N

          Better make the most of it, then.

          He went back to the world of numbers so complex that they had no meaning, only a transitional point of view. And got on with freezing to death, as well.

        quote: |
          There was quite a crowd around them when they finally got the main door open. Lumps of ice clinked on the stones, and there was a rush of supercold air.

          Frost covered the floor and the rows of hanging carcasses on their backward journey through time. It also covered a Detritus-shaped lump squatting in the middle of the floor.

          They carried it out into the sunlight.

          “Should his eyes be flashing on and off like that?” said Dibbler.

          “Can you hear me?” shouted Cuddy. “Detritus?”

          Detritus blinked. Ice slid off him in the day’s heat.

          He could feel the cracking up of the marvelous universe of numbers. The rising temperature hit his thoughts like a flame-thrower caressing a snowflake.

          “Say something!” said Cuddy.

          Towers of intellect collapsed as the fire roared through Detritus’ brain.

          “Hey, look at this,” said one of the apprentices.

          The inner walls of the warehouse were covered with numbers. Equations as complex as a neural network had been scraped in the frost. At some point in the calculation the mathematician had changed from using numbers to using letters, and then letters themselves hadn’t been sufficient; brackets like cages enclosed expressions which were to normal mathematics what a city is to a map.

          They got simpler as the goal neared—simpler, yet containing in the flowing lines of their simplicity a spartan and wonderful complexity.

          Cuddy stared at them. He knew he’d never be able to understand them in a hundred years.

          The frost crumbled in the warmer air.

          The equations narrowed as they were carried on down the wall and across the floor to where the troll had been sitting, until they became just a few expressions that appeared to move and sparkle with a life of their own. This was maths without numbers, pure as lightning.

          They narrowed to a point, and at the point was just the very simple symbol: “=”.

          “Equals what?” said Cuddy. “Equals what?”

          The frost collapsed.

          Cuddy went outside. Detritus was now sitting in a puddle of water, surrounded by a crowd of human onlookers.

          “Can’t one of you get him a blanket or something?” he said.

          A very fat man said, “Huh? Who’d use a blanket after it had been on a troll?”

          “Hah, yes, good point,” said Cuddy. He glanced at the five holes in Detritus’ breastplate. They were at about head height, for a dwarf. “Could you come over here for moment, please?”

          The man grinned at his friends, and sauntered over.

          “I expect you can see the holes in his armor, right?” said Cuddy.

          C. M. O. T. Dibbler was a survivor. In the same way that rodents and insects can sense an earthquake ahead of the first tremors, so he could tell if something big was about to go down on the street. Cuddy was being too nice. When a dwarf was nice like that, it meant he was saving up to be nasty later on.

          “I’ll just, er, go about my business, then,” he said, and backed away.

          “I’ve got nothing against dwarfs, mind you,” said the fat man. “I mean, dwarfs is practically people, in my book. Just shorter humans, almost. But trolls…weeeelll…they’re not the same as us, right?”

          “’scuse me, ’scuse me, gangway, gangway,” said Dibbler, achieving with his cart the kind of getaway customarily associated with vehicles that have fluffy dice on the windscreen.

          “That’s a nice coat you’ve got there,” said Cuddy.

          Dibbler’s cart went around the corner on one wheel.

          “It’s a nice coat,” said Cuddy. “You know what you should do with a coat like that?”

          The man’s forehead wrinkled.

          “Take it off right now,” said Cuddy, “and give it to the troll.”

          “Why, you little—”

          The man grabbed Cuddy by his shirt and wrenched him upward.

          The dwarf’s hand moved very quickly. There was a scrape of metal.

          Man and dwarf made an interesting and absolute stationary tableau for a few seconds.

          Cuddy had been brought up almost level with the man’s face, and watched with interest as the eyes began to water.

          “Let me down,” said Cuddy. “Gently. I make involuntary muscle movements if I’m startled.”

          The man did so.

          “Now take off your coat…good…just pass it over…thank you…”

          “Your axe…” the man murmured.

          “Axe? Axe? My axe?” Cuddy looked down. “Well, well, well. Hardly knew I was holding it there. My axe. Well, there’s a thing.”

          The man was trying to stand on tiptoe. His eyes were watering.

          “The thing about this axe,” said Cuddy, “the interesting thing, is that it’s a throwing axe. I was champion three years running up at Copperhead. I could draw it and split a twig thirty yards away in one second. Behind me. And I was ill that day. A bilious attack.”

          He backed away. The man sank gratefully on to his heels.

          Cuddy draped the coat over the troll’s shoulders.

          “Come on, on your feet,” he said. “Let’s get you home.”

          The troll lumbered upright.

          “How many fingers am I holding up?” said Cuddy.

          Detritus peered.

          “Two and one?” he suggested.

          “It’ll do,” said Cuddy. “For a start.”

        “In fact, I wanted to see you about one of the students, Master,” he said coldly.

        The Silver Horde wandered through the alleys of Hunghung.

        “I don’t call this bloody well sweeping through a city, slaughtering every bugger,” muttered Truckle. “When I was riding with Bruce the Hoon, we never walked in through a front gate like a bunch of soppy mother—”

        “Mr. Uncivil,” said Mr. Saveloy hurriedly, “I wonder if this might be a good time to refer you to that list I drew up for you?”

        “What bloody list?” said Truckle, sticking out his jaw belligerently.

        “The list of acceptable civilized words, yes?” He turned to the others. “Remember I was telling you about civ-il-ized be-hav-ior. Civilized behavior is vital to our long-term strategy.”

        “What’s a long-term strategy?” said Caleb the Ripper.

        “It’s what we’re going to do later,” said Cohen.

        “And what’s that, then?”

        “It’s the Plan,” said Cohen.

        “Well, I’ll be f—” Truckle began.

        “The list, Mr. Uncivil, only the words on the list,” snapped Mr. Saveloy. “Listen, I bow to your expertise when it comes to crossing wilderness, but this is civilization and you must use the right words. Please?”

        “Better do what he says, Truckle,” said Cohen.

        With bad grace, Truckle fished a grubby piece of paper out of his pocket and unfolded it.

        “‘Dang’?” he said. “Wassat mean? And what’s this ‘darn’ and ‘heck’?”

        “They are…civilized swearwords,” said Mr. Saveloy.

        “Well, you can take ’em and—”

        “Ah?” said Mr. Saveloy, raising a cautionary finger.

        “You can shove them up—”

        “Ah?”

        “You can—”

        “Ah?”

        Truckle shut his eyes and clenched his fists.

        “Dang it all to heck!” he shouted.

        “Good,” said Mr. Saveloy. “That’s much better.”

        He turned to Cohen, who was grinning happily at Truckle’s discomfort.

        “Cohen,” he said, “there’s an apple stall over there. Do you fancy an apple?”

        “Yeah, might do,” Cohen conceded, in the cautious manner of someone giving a conjuror his watch while remaining aware that the man is grinning and holding a hammer.

        “Right. Now, then, cla—I mean, gentlemen. Ghenghiz wants an apple. There’s a stall over there selling fruit and nuts. What does he do?” Mr. Saveloy looked hopefully at his charges. “Anyone? Yes?”

        “Easy. You kill that little”—there was a rustle of unfolding paper again—“chap behind the stall, then—”

        “No, Mr. Uncivil. Anyone else?”

        “Whut?”

        “You set fire to—”

        “No, Mr. Vincent. Anyone else…?”

        “You rape—”

        “No, no, Mr. Ripper,” said Mr. Saveloy. “We take out some muh—muh—?” He looked at them expectantly.

        “—money—” chorused the Horde.

        “—and we…What do we do? Now, we’ve gone through this hundreds of times. We…”

        This was the difficult bit. The Horde’s lined faces creased and puckered still further as they tried to force their minds out of the chasms of habit.

        “Gi…?” said Cohen hesitantly. Mr. Saveloy gave him a big smile and a nod of encouragement.

        “Give?…it…to…” Cohen’s lips tensed around the word “…him?”

        “Yes! Well done. In exchange for the apple. We’ll talk about making change and saying ‘thank you’ later on, when you’re ready for it. Now then, Cohen, here’s the coin. Off you go.”

        Cohen wiped his forehead. He was beginning to sweat.

        “How about if I just cut him up a bit—”

        “No! This is civilization.”

        Cohen nodded uncomfortably. He threw back his shoulders and walked over to the stall, where the apple merchant, who had been eying the group suspiciously, nodded at him.

        Cohen’s eyes glazed and his lips moved silently, as if he were rehearsing a script. Then he said:

        “Ho, fat merchant, give me all your…one apple…and I will give you…this coin…”

        He looked around. Mr. Saveloy had his thumb up.

        “You want an apple, is that it?” said the apple merchant.

        “Yes!”

        The apple merchant selected one. Cohen’s sword had been hidden in the wheelchair again but the merchant, in response to some buried acknowledgement, made sure it was a good apple. Then he took the coin. This proved a little difficult, since his customer seemed loath to let go of it.

        “Come on, hand it over, venerable one,” he said.

        Seven crowded seconds passed.

        Then, when they were safely around the corner, Mr. Saveloy said, “Now, everyone: who can tell me what Ghenghiz did wrong?”

        “Didn’t say please?”

        “Whut?”

        “No.”

        “Didn’t say thank you?”

        “Whut?”

        “No.”

        “Hit the man over the head with a melon and thumped him into the strawberries and kicked him in the nuts and set fire to his stall and stole all the money?”

        “Whut?”

        “Correct!” Mr. Saveloy sighed. “Ghenghiz, you were doing so well up to then.”

        “He didn’t ort to have called me what he did!”

        “But ‘venerable’ means old and wise, Ghenghiz.”

        “Oh. Does it?”

        “Yes.”

        “We-ell…I did leave him the money for the apple.”

        “Yes, but, you see, I do believe you took all his other money.”

        “But I paid for the apple,” said Cohen, rather testily.

        Mr. Saveloy sighed. “Ghenghiz, I do rather get the impression that several thousand years of the patient development of fiscal propriety have somewhat passed you by.”

        “Come again?”

        “It is possible sometimes for money to legitimately belong to other people,” said Mr. Saveloy patiently.

        The Horde paused to wrap their minds around this, too. It was, of course, something they knew to be true in theory. Merchants always had money. But it seemed wrong to think of it as belonging to them; it belonged to whoever took it off them. Merchants didn’t actually own it, they were just looking after it until it was needed.

        “Now, there is an elderly lady over there selling ducks,” said Mr. Saveloy. “I think the next stage—Mr. Willie, I am not over there, I am sure whatever you are looking at is very interesting, but please pay attention—is to practice our grasp of social intercourse.”

        “Hur, hur, hur,” said Caleb the Ripper.

        “I mean, Mr. Ripper, that you should go and enquire how much it would be for a duck,” said Mr. Saveloy.

        “Hur, hur, hur—What?”

        “And you are not to rip all her clothes off. That’s not civilized.”

        Caleb scratched his head. Flakes fell out.

        “Well, what else am I supposed to do?”

        “Er…engage her in conversation.”

        “Eh? What’s there to talk about with a woman?”

        Mr. Saveloy hesitated again. To some extent this was unknown territory to him as well. His experience with women at his last school had been limited to an occasional chat with the housekeeper, and on one occasion the matron had let him put his hand on her knee. He had been forty before he found out that oral sex didn’t mean talking about it. Women had always been to him strange and distant and wonderful creatures rather than, as the Horde to a man believed, something to do. He was struggling a little.

        “The weather?” he hazarded. His memory threw in vague recollections of the staple conversation of the maiden aunt who had brought him up. “Her health? The trouble with young people today?”

        “And then I rip her clothes off?”

        “Possibly. Eventually. If she wants you to. I might draw your attention to the discussion we had the other day about taking regular baths”—or even a bath, he added to himself—“and attention to fingernails and hair and changing your clothes more often.”

        “This is leather,” said Caleb. “You don’t have to change it, it don’t rot for years.”

        Once again Mr. Saveloy readjusted his sights. He’d thought that Civilization could be overlaid on the Horde like a veneer. He had been mistaken.

    Hogfather:
      - “And don’t forget the presents,” said the Chair of Indefinite Studies, as if reading off some internal list of gloom. “How…how full of potential they seem in all that paper, how pregnant with possibilities…and then you open them and basically the wrapping paper was more interesting and you have to say ‘How thoughtful, that will come in handy.’ **It’s not better to give than to receive, in my opinion, it’s just less embarrassing.”**

      - Death lived in a black world, where nothing was alive and everything was dark and his great library only had dust and cobwebs because he’d created them for effect and there was never any sun in the sky and the air never moved and he had an umbrella stand. And a pair of silver-backed hairbrushes by his bed. He wanted to be something more than just a bony apparition. He tried to create these flashes of personality but somehow they betrayed themselves, they **tried too hard, like an adolescent boy going out wearing an after-shave called “Rampant.”**

      - |
        “Well, he’s for kids, isn’t he?” said the Dean. “But I’m sure they all believe in him. I certainly did. It wouldn’t be Hogswatch when I was a kid without a pillowcase hanging by the fire—”

        “A pillowcase?” said the Senior Wrangler, sharply.

        “Well, you can’t get much in a stocking,” said the Dean.

        “Yes, but a whole pillowcase?” the Senior Wrangler insisted.

        “Yes. What of it?”

        “Is it just me, or is that a rather greedy and selfish way to behave? In my family we just hung up very small socks,” said the Senior Wrangler. “A sugar pig, a toy soldier, a couple of oranges and that was it. Hah, turns out people with whole pillowcases were cornering the market, eh?”

        “Shut up and stop squabbling, both of you,” said Ridcully. “There must be a simple way to check up. How can you tell if the Hogfather exists?”

        “Someone’s drunk the sherry, there’s sooty footprints on the carpet, sleigh tracks on the roof and **your pillowcase is full of presents**,” said the Dean.

      - |
        The Senior Wrangler wasn’t attending the Feast. He got one of the maids to bring a tray up to his rooms, where he was Entertaining and doing all those things a man does when he finds himself unexpectedly tête-à-tête with the opposite sex, like trying to shine his boots on his trousers and clean his fingernails with his other fingernails.

        “A little more wine, Gwendoline? It’s hardly alcoholic,” he said, leaning over her.

        “I don’t mind if I do, Mr. Wrangler.”

        “Oh, call me Horace, please. And perhaps a little something for your chicken?”

        “I’m afraid she seems to have wandered off somewhere,” said the Cheerful Fairy. “I’m afraid I’m, I’m, I’m rather dull company…” She blew her nose noisily.

        “Oh, I certainly wouldn’t say that,” said the Senior Wrangler. He wished he’d had time to tidy up his rooms a bit, or at least get some of the more embarrassing bits of laundry off the stuffed rhinoceros.

        “Everyone’s been so kind,” said the Cheerful Fairy, dabbing at her streaming eyes. “Who was the skinny one that kept making the funny faces for me?”

        “That was the Bursar. Why don’t you—”

        “He seemed very cheerful, anyway.”

        “It’s the dried frog pills, he eats them by the handful,” said the Senior Wrangler dismissively. “I say, why don’t—”

        “Oh dear. I hope they’re not addictive.”

        “I’m sure he wouldn’t keep on eating them if they were addictive,” said the Senior Wrangler. “Now, why don’t you have another glass of wine, and then…and then…” a happy thought struck him “…and then…and then perhaps I could show you Archchancellor Bowell’s Remembrance? It’s got a-a-a-a very interesting ceiling. My word, yes.”

        “That would be very nice,” said the Cheerful Fairy. “Would it cheer me up, do you think?”

        “Oh, it would, it would,” said the Senior Wrangler. “Definitely! Good! So I’ll, er, I’ll just go and…just go and…I’ll…” He pointed vaguely in the direction of his dressing room, while hopping from one foot to the other. “I’ll just go and, er…go…just…”

        He fled into the dressing room and slammed the door behind him. His wild eyes scanned the shelves and hangers.

        “Clean robe,” he mumbled. “Comb face, wash socks, fresh hair, where’s that **Insteadofshave lotion**—”

    Jingo:

        “Rather a lonely person, our Nobby,” said Carrot.

        “Well, yes…”

        “But I’m sure he’ll find the right person for him,” Carrot added, cheerfully.

        Probably in a bottle, said Angua to herself. She remembered the conversation with him. It was a terrible thing to think, but there was something itchy about the thought of **Nobby being allowed in the gene pool, even at the shallow end**.

      - |
        They looked up. Someone with a face and apron that said “barman” in seven hundred languages was standing over them, a wine jug in each hand.

        “No women in here,” he went on.

        “Why not?” said Nobby.

        “No women asking questions, neither.”

        “Why not?”

        “’cos it is written, that’s why.”

        “Where’m I supposed to go, then?”

        The barman shrugged. “Who knows where women go?”

        “Off you go, Beti,” said the Patrician. “And…listen for information!”

        Nobby grabbed the cup of wine from Colon and gulped it down.

        “I dunno,” he moaned, **“I’ve only been a woman ten minutes and already I hate you male bastards.”**

        MR. SLOPES?

        Snowy Slopes gingerly felt his neck, or at least the neck of his soul. The human soul tends to keep to the shape of the original body for some time after death. Habit is a wonderful thing.

        “Who the hell was he?” he said.

        NOT SOMEONE YOU KNOW? said Death.

        “Well, no! I don’t know many people who cut my head off!”

        Snowy Slopes’s body had knocked against the table as it fell. Several bottles of medicated shampoo now dripped and mixed their contents into the other more intimate fluids from the Slopes corpse.

        “That stuff with the special oil in it cost me nearly four dollars,” said Snowy. Yet, somehow, it all seemed slightly…irrelevant now. Death happens to other people. The other person in this case had been him. That is, the one down there. Not the one standing here looking at it. In life, Snowy hadn’t even been able to spell “metaphysical,” but he was already beginning to view life in a different way. From the outside, for a start.

        “Four dollars,” he repeated. “I never even had time to try it!”

        IT WOULDN’T HAVE WORKED, said Death, patting the man on a fading shoulder. BUT, IF I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT YOU LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, IT WILL NO LONGER BE NECESSARY.

        **“No more dandruff?”** said Snowy, now quite transparent and fading fast.

        EVER, said Death. TRUST ME ON THIS.

        …Also, we went to the bow shops in the Street of Cunning Artificers and showed the iconograph to the man in Burleigh and Stronginthearm, who vouchsafed, that is him, e.g., he was referring to the Diseased…

        “Oh, my…” Vimes’s lips moved slightly as his gaze went back up the page.

        …also in addition to the Klatchian money you could tell one of them had been there because of, e.g., the sand on the floor…

        “He’d still got sand in his sandals?” murmured Vimes. “Good grief.”

        “Sam?”

        Vimes looked up from his reading.

        “Your soup will be cold,” said Lady Sybil from the far end of the table. “You’ve been holding that spoonful in the air for the last five minutes by the clock.”

        “Sorry, dear.”

        “What are you reading?”

        “Oh, just a little masterpiece,” said Vimes, pushing Fred Colon’s report aside.

        “Interesting, is it?” said Lady Sybil a little sourly.

        “Practically unparalleled,” said Vimes. “The only things they haven’t found are the bunch of dates and the camel hidden under the pillow…”

        Belatedly, his nuptial radar detected a certain chilliness from the far side of the cruet.

        “Is, er, there something wrong, dear?” he said.

        “Can you remember when we last had dinner together, Sam?”

        “Tuesday, wasn’t it?”

        “That was the Guild of Merchants’ annual dinner, Sam.”

        Vimes’s brow wrinkled. “But you were there, too, weren’t you?”

        A further subtle change in the dragonhouse quotient told him that this was not a well chosen answer.

        “And then you rushed off afterward because of that business with the barber in Gleam Street.”

        “Sweeney Jones,” said Vimes. “Well, he was killing people, Sybil. The best you could say is that he didn’t mean to. **He was just very bad at shaving—”**

    Last Continent:
      - |
        “Amazin’ piece of work,” said Ridcully, emerging from the elephant. “Very good wheels. You paint these bits before assembly, do you?”

        “It’s not a kit, sir,” said Ponder, taking a kidney out of his hands and wedging it back in. “It’s a real elephant under construction!”

        “Oh.”

        “Being made, sir,” said Ponder, since Ridcully didn’t seem to have got the message. “Which is not usual.”

        “Ah. How are they normally made, then?”

        “By other elephants, sir.”

        “Oh, yes…”

        “Really? Are they?” said the god. “How? Those trunks are pretty nimble, even if I say so myself, but not really very good for delicate work.”

        “Oh, not made like that, sir, obviously. By…you know…sex…” said Ponder, feeling a blush start.

        “Sex?”

        Then Ponder thought: Mono Island. Oh dear…

        “Er…males and females…” he ventured.

        “What are they, then?” said the god. The wizards paused.

        “Do go on, Mister Stibbons,” said the Archchancellor. “We’re all ears. Especially the elephant.”

        “Well…” Ponder knew he was going red. “Er…well, how do you get flowers and things at the moment?”

        “I make them,” said the god. “And then I keep an eye on them and see how they function and then when they wear out I make an improved version based on experimental results.” He frowned. “Although the plants seem to be acting very oddly these days. What’s the point of these seeds they keep making? I try to discourage it but they don’t seem to listen.”

        “I think…er…they’re trying to invent sex, sir,” said Ponder. “Er…sex is how you can…they can…creatures can…they can make the next…creatures.”

        “You mean…elephants can make more elephants?”

        “Yes, sir.”

        “My word! Really?”

        “Oh, yes.”

        “How do they go about that? Calibrating the ear-waggling is particularly time-consuming. Do they use special tools?”

        Ponder saw that the Dean was staring straight up at the ceiling, while the other wizards were also finding something apparently fascinating to look at that meant they could avoid one another’s gaze.

        “Um, in a way,” said Ponder. He knew that a sticky patch lay ahead and decided to give up. “But really I don’t know much about—”

        “And workshops, presumably,” said the god. He took a book from his pocket and a pencil from behind his ear. “Do you mind if I make notes?”

        “They…er…the female…” Ponder tried.

        “Female,” said the god obediently, writing this down.

        “Well, she…one popular way…she…sort of makes the next one…inside her.”

        The god stopped writing. “Now I know that’s not right,” he said. “You can’t make an elephant inside an elephant—”

        “Er…a smaller version…”

        “Ah, once again I have to point out the flaw. After a few such constructions you’d end up with an elephant the size of a rabbit.”

        “Er, it gets bigger later…”

        “Really? How?”

        “It sort of…builds itself…er…from the inside…”

        “And the other one, the one that is not the, uh, female? What is its part in all this? Is your colleague ill?”

        The Senior Wrangler hammered the Dean hard on the back.

        “It’s all right,” squeaked the Dean, “…often have…these…coughing fits…”

        The god scribbled industriously for a few seconds, and then stopped and chewed the end of his pencil thoughtfully.

        “And all this, er, this sex is done by unskilled labor?” he said.

        “Oh, yes.”

        “No quality control of any description?”

        “Er, no.”

        “How does your species go about it?” said the god. He looked questioningly at Ponder.

        “It…er…we…er…” Ponder stuttered.

        “We avoid it,” said Ridcully. “Nasty cough you’ve got there, Dean.”
        “Really?” said the god. “That’s very interesting. What do you do instead? Split down the middle? That works beautifully for amoebas, but giraffes find it extremely difficult, I do know that.”

        “What? No, we concentrate on higher things,” said Ridcully. “And take cold baths, healthy morning runs, that sort of thing.”

        “My goodness, I’d better make a note of that,” said the god, patting his robe. “How does the process work, exactly? Do the females accompany you? These higher things…How high, precisely? This is a very interesting concept. Presumably extra orifices are required?”

        “What? Pardon?” said Ponder.

        “Getting creatures to make themselves, eh? I thought this whole seed business was just high spirits but, yes, I can see that it would save a lot of work, a lot of work. Of course, there’d have to be some extra effort at the design stage, certainly, but afterwards I suppose it’d practically run itself…” The god’s hand blurred as he wrote, and he went on, “Hmm, drives and imperatives, they’re going to be vital…er…How does it work with, say, trees?”

        “You just need Ponder’s uncle and a paintbrush,” said the Senior Wrangler.

        “Sir!” said Ponder hotly.

        The god gave them both a look of intelligent bewilderment, like a man who had just heard a joke told in a completely foreign language and isn’t sure if the speaker has got to the punch line yet. Then he shrugged.

        “The only thing I think I don’t quite understand,” he said, “is why any creature would want to spend time on all this…” he peered at his notes, “this sex, when they could be enjoying themselves…Oh dear, your associate seems to be choking this time, I’m afraid…”

        “Dean!” shouted Ridcully.

        “I can’t help noticing,” said the god, “that when sex is being discussed your faces redden and you tend to shift uneasily from one foot to the other. Is this some sort of signal?”

        “Erm…”

        “If you could just tell me how it all works…”

        Embarrassment filled the air, huge and pink. If it were rock, you could have carved great hidden rose-red cities in it.

        Ridcully smiled a petrified smile. “Excuse us,” he said. “Faculty meeting, gentlemen?”

        Ponder watched the wizards go into a huddle. He could hear a few phrases above the susurration.

        “…my father said, but of course I didn’t believe…never raised its ugly head…Dean, will you shut up? We can’t very well…cold showers, really…”

        Ridcully turned back and flashed the stony smile again. “Sex is, er, not something we talk about,” he said.

        “Much,” said the Dean.

        “Oh, I see,” said the god. “Well, a practical demonstration would be so much more comprehendible.”

        “Er, we weren’t, er…planning a…”

        “Coo-eee! There you are, gentlemen!”

        Mrs. Whitlow entered the cave. The wizards went suddenly quiet, sensing in their wizardly minds that the introduction of Mrs. Whitlow at this point was an electric fire in the swimming pool of life.

        “Oh, another one of you,” said the god brightly. He focused. “Or a different species, perhaps?”
        Ponder felt that he had to say something. Mrs. Whitlow was giving him a Look.

        “Mrs., er, Whitlow is, er, a lady,” he said.

        “Ah, I shall make a note of it,” said the god. “And what sort of thing do they do?”

        “They’re, um, the same species as, er, us,” said Ponder, miserably. Um…the…um…”

        “Weaker sex,” Ridcully supplied.

        “Sorry, you’ve lost me there,” said the god.

        “Er…she’s, um, er, a…of the female persuasion,” said Ponder.

        The god smiled happily. “Oh, how very convenient,” he said.

        “Excuse me” said Mrs. Whitlow, in as sharp a tone as she cared to use around the wizards, “but will someone introduce this gentleman to me?”

        “Oh, yes, of course,” said Ridcully. “Do excuse me. God, this is Mrs. Whitlow. Mrs. Whitlow, this is God. A god. God of this island, in fact. Uh…”

        “Charmed, Ai’m sure,” said Mrs. Whitlow. In Mrs. Whitlow’s book, gods were socially very acceptable, at least if they had proper human heads and wore clothes; they rated above High Priests and occupied the same level as Dukes.

        “Should Ai kneel?” she said.

        “Mwaaa,” whimpered the Senior Wrangler.

        “Genuflection of any sort is not required,” said the god.

        “He means no,” said Ponder.

        “Oh, as you wish,” said Mrs. Whitlow. She extended a hand.

        The god grasped it and waggled her thumb backwards and forward.

        “Very practical,” he said. “Opposable, I see. I think I should make a note of this. Do you brachiate? Are you bipedal by habit? Oh, I notice your eyebrows go up, too. Is this a signal of some sort? I also note that you are a different shape from the others and don’t have a beard. I assume that means you are less wise?”

        Ponder saw Mrs. Whitlow’s eyes narrow and her nostrils flare.

        “Is there some sort of problem, sirs?” she said. “Ai followed your footprints to that funny boat, and this was the only other path, so—”

        “We were discussing sex,” said the god enthusiastically. “It sounds very exciting, don’t you think?”

        The wizards held their breath. This was going to make the Dean’s sheets look very minor.

        “It’s not a subject on which Ai would venture an opinion,” said Mrs. Whitlow carefully.

        “Mwaa,” squeaked the Senior Wrangler.

        “No one seems to want to tell me,” said the god irritably. A spark leapt from his fingers and blew a very small crater in the floor, and that seemed to shock him as much as it did the wizards.

        “Oh dear, what can you think of me? I’m so sorry!” he said. “I’m afraid it’s a sort of natural reaction if I get a bit, you know…testy.”

        Everyone looked at the crater. The rock bubbled gently by Ponder’s feet. He didn’t dare move his sandal, just in case he fainted.

        “That was just…testy, was it?” said Ridcully.

        “Well, it may have been more…vexed, I suppose,” said the god. “I can’t really help it, it’s a god-given reflex. I’m afraid as a…well, species, we’re not good with, you know, defiance. I’m so sorry. So sorry.” He blew his nose, and sat down on a half-finished panda. “Oh, dear. There I go again…” A tiny bolt of lightning flashed off his thumb and exploded. “I hope it’s not going to be the city of Quint all over again. Of course, you know what happened there…”

        “I’ve never heard of the city of Quint,” said Ponder.

        “Yes, I suppose you wouldn’t have,” said the god. “That’s the whole point, really. It wasn’t much of a city. It was mostly made of mud. Well, I say mud. Afterwards, of course, it was mainly ceramics.” He turned a wretched face to them. “You know those days you get when you just snap at everyone?”

        Out of the corner of his eye Ponder had noticed that the wizards, in a rare show of unanimity, were shuffling sideways, very slowly, towards the door.

        A much bigger thunderbolt blew a hole in the floor near the cave entrance.

        “Oh dear, where can I put my face?” said the god. “It’s all subconscious, I’m afraid.”

        “Could you get treatment for premature incineration?”

        “Dean! This is not the time!”

        “Sorry, Archchancellor.”

        “If only they hadn’t turned up their noses at my inflammable cows,” said the god, sparks fizzing off his beard. “All right, I would agree that on hot days, in certain rare circumstances, they would spontaneously combust and burn down the village, but is that any excuse for ingratitude?”

        Mrs. Whitlow had been giving the god a long, cool stare. “What exactly is it you wish to know?” she said.

        “Huh?” said Ridcully.

        “Well, Ai mean no offense, but Ai for one would like to get out of here without mai hair on fire,” said the housekeeper.

        The god looked up. “This male and female concept seems really rather promising,” he said, sniffing. “But no one seems to want to go into detail…”

        “Oh, that,” said Mrs. Whitlow. She glanced at the wizards, and then gently pulled the god to his feet. “If you will excuse me for one moment, gentlemen…”

        The wizards watched them in even more shock than had attended the lightning display, and then the Chair of Indefinite Studies pulled his hat over his eyes.

        “I daren’t look,” he said, and added, “What are they doing?”

        “Er…just talking…” said Ponder.

        “Talking?”

        “And she’s…sort of…waving her hands about.”

        “Mwaa!” said the Senior Wrangler.

        “Quick, someone, give him some air,” said Ridcully. “Now she’s laughing, isn’t she?”

        Both the housekeeper and the god looked around at the wizards. Mrs. Whitlow nodded her head as if to reassure him that what she’d just told him was true, and they both laughed.

        “That looked more like a snigger,” said the Dean severely.

        “I’m not sure I actually approve of this,” said Ridcully, haughtily. “Gods and mortal women, you know. You hear stories.”

        “Gods turning themselves into bulls,” said the Dean.

        “Swans, too,” said the Chair of Indefinite Studies.

        “Showers of gold,” said the Dean.

        “Yes,” said the Chair. He paused for a second. “You know, I’ve often wondered about that one—”

        “What’s she describing now?”

        “I think I’d rather not know, quite frankly.”

        “Oh, look, someone please do something for the Senior Wrangler, will you?” said Ridcully. “Loosen his clothing or something!”

        They heard the god shout, “It what?” Mrs. Whitlow glanced around at the wizards and appeared to lower her voice.

        “Did anyone ever meet Mr. Whitlow?” said the Archchancellor.

        “Well…no,” said the Dean. “Not that I remember. I suppose we’ve all assumed that he’s dead.”

        “Anyone know what he died of?” Ridcully went on. “Ah, quieten down…they’re coming back…”

        The god nodded cheerfully at them as he approached.

        “Well, that’s all sorted out,” he said, rubbing his hands together. “I can’t wait to see how it works in practice. You know, if I’d sat here for a hundred years I’d never have…well, really, no one could serious believe…I mean…” He started to chuckle at their frozen faces. “That bit where he…and then she…Really, I’m amazed that anyone stops laughing long enough to…Still, I can see how it could work, and it certainly opens the door to some very interesting possibilities indeed…”

        Mrs. Whitlow was looking intently at the ceiling. There was perhaps just a hint in her stance and the way her rather expressive bosom moved that she was trying not to laugh. It was disconcerting. Mrs. Whitlow never usually laughed at anything.

        “Ah? Oh?” said Ridcully, edging towards the door. “Really? Well done, then. So, I expect you don’t need us any more, eh? Only we’ve got a boat to catch…”

        “Yes, certainly, don’t let me hold you up,” said the god, waving a hand vaguely. “You know, the more I think about it, the more I can see that ‘sex’ will solve practically all my problems.”

        “Not everyone can say that,” said Ridcully gravely. “Are you, er…joining us, Mrs., er, Whitlow?”

        “Certainly, Archchancellor.”

        “Er…jolly good. Well done. Ahem. And you, of course, Mister Stibbons…”

        “Nanny?”

        “Yes, luv?”

        “**Are there such things as blue mice?**”

        “**Not while you’re sober, dear.**”

        “I think…I’m owed a drink, then. Is there any brandy left?”

      - |
        “I think these really are new vampires,” said Agnes. “They really aren’t like the old sort.”

        “Then we face ’em here and now,” said Nanny. “That’s what Esme would do, sure enough.”

        “But are we strong enough?” said Agnes. Granny wouldn’t have asked, said Perdita.

        “There’s three of us, isn’t there?” said Nanny. She produced a flask, and uncorked it. “And a bit of help. Anyone else want some?”

        “That’s brandy, Nanny!” said Magrat. **“Do you want to face the vampires drunk?”**

        “Sounds a whole lot better than facin’ them sober,” said Nanny, taking a gulp and shuddering. “Only sensible bit of advice Agnes got from Mister Oats, I reckon. Vampire hunters need to be a little bit tipsy, he said. Well, I always listen to good advice…”

        “Things were simpler then,” said the Count. “And also very, very stupid.” He sighed. “Where the hell’s Igor?”

        “Ahem. I’ve been meaning to talk to you about him, dear,” said the Countess. “I think he’ll have to go.”

        “That’s right!” snapped Lacrimosa. “Honestly, even my friends laugh at him!’

        “I find his more-gothic-than-thou attitude extremely irritating,” said the Countess. “That stupid accent…and do you know what I found him doing in the old dungeons last week?”

        “I’m sure I couldn’t guess,” said the Count.

        “He had a **box of spiders and a whip! He was forcing them to make webs** all over the place.”

        “I wondered why there was always so many, I must admit,” said the Count.

    The Fifth Elephant:
      - |
        The fatter of the two hesitated, and then held out his hand.

        “Pisspot,” he said.

        “Inigo?” said Vimes quietly, without turning his head.

        “Ah,” said Inigo, after some muttered exchanges. “Now the problem seems to be Sergeant Detritus. No trolls are allowed in this part of town during the hours of daylight, apparently, without a passport signed by their…owner. Uh…in Bonk the only trolls allowed are prisoners of war. They have to carry identification.”

        “Detritus is a citizen of Ankh-Morpork and my sergeant,” said Vimes.

        “However, he is a troll. Perhaps in the interests of diplomacy you could write a short—”

        “Do I need a pisspot?”

        “A passport…no, Your Grace.”

        “Then he doesn’t, either.”

        “Nevertheless, Your Grace—”

        “There is no nevertheless.”

        “But it may be advisable to—”

        “There’s no advisable, either.”

        A few other guards had drifted over. Vimes was aware of watching eyes.

        “He could be ejected by force,” said Inigo.

        “Now there’s an experiment I wouldn’t want to miss,” said Vimes.

        Detritus made a rumbling noise. “I don’t mind goin’ back if—”

        **“Shut up, Sergeant. You’re a free troll. That’s an order.”**

      - |
        “People down there aren’t happy,” said Vimes. “That looks like a mob to me. Look, you can tell by the way they move…”

        “Commander Vimes?”

        He turned. In the gloom he could make out several dwarfs, each with a candle fixed to his helmet. In front of them was, presumably, another dwarf.

        He’d seen clothes like this in Ankh-Morpork, but always scurrying away. This was…a deep-down dwarf.

        It was wearing some sort of robe made of overlapping leather plates. Instead of the small round iron helmet which Vimes had always thought dwarfs were born with, it had a pointed leather hat with more leather flaps all around it. The one at the front had been tied up, to allow the wearer to look out at the world, or at least that part of it that was underground. The general effect was of a mobile cone.

        “Er…yes, that’s me,” said Vimes.

        “Welcome to Shmaltzberg, Your Excellency. I am the king’s jar’ahk’haga, which in your language you would call—”

        But Vimes’s lips had been moving fast as he tried to translate.

        “Ideas…taster?” he said.

        “Hah! That would be a way of putting it, yes. My name…is Dee. Would you care to follow me? This should not take long.”

        The figure swept away. One of the other dwarfs prodded Vimes very gently, indicating that he should follow.

        The sound from far below redoubled. Someone was yelling.

        “Is there some problem?” said Vimes, catching up with the fast-moving Dee.

        “We have no problems.”

        Ah, **he’s already lied to me**, thought Vimes. **We’re being diplomatic.**

      - |
        “Your Grace!”

        Dee was advancing through the crowds.

        “Ah, Ideas-taster,” said Vimes. as the dwarf approached, “do allow me to introduce the Duchess of Ankh-Morpork…Lady Sybil.”

        “Uh…er…yes…indeed…so delighted to make your acquaintance…” Dee murmured, caught off-guard by the charm offensive. “But, er…”

        Sybil had picked up the code. Vimes loathed the word “duchess,” so if he was using it then he wanted her to out-dutch everyone. She enveloped Dee’s pointy head in delighted Duchessness.

        “Mister Dee, Sam has told me so much about you!” she trilled. “I understand you’re quite the right-hand man—”

        “—dwarf—” hissed Vimes.

        “—dwarf to his majesty! Please, you must tell how you have achieved such a delightful lighting effect here!”

        “Er…lots of candles…” Dee muttered, glaring at Vimes.

        “I think Dee wishes to discuss some political matters with me, dear,” said Vimes smoothly, putting his hand on the dwarf’s shoulder. “If you’ll just take the others down, I’ll join you shortly, I’m sure.” And he knew that no power in the world was going to prevent Sybil sweeping on down to the reception. That woman could sweep. Things stayed swept after she’d gone past.

        “You brought a troll, you brought a troll!” muttered Dee.

        “And he’s an Ankh-Morpork citizen, remember,” said Vimes. “Covered by diplomatic immunity and a rather bad suit.”

        “Even so—”

        “There is no ‘even so,’” said Vimes.

        “We are at war with the trolls!”

        “Well, that’s what diplomacy is all about, isn’t it?” said Vimes. “A way to stop being at war? Anyway, I understand it’s been going on for five hundred years, so obviously no one is trying very hard.”

    The Truth:
      - |
        “Gangvay, gangvay, please!”

        Otto pushed his way through the onlookers, struggling under the weight of a device the size and general shape of an accordion. He elbowed his way to the front of the crowd, balanced the device on its tripod, and aimed it towards a golem who was climbing out of a smoking window holding a small child.

        “All right, boys, zis is zer big vun!” he said, and raised the flash cage. “Vun, two, thre—aarghaarghaarghaargh…”

        The vampire became a cloud of gently settling dust. For a moment something hovered in the air. It looked like a small jar on a necklace made of string.

        Then it fell and smashed on the cobbles.

        The dust mushroomed up, took on a shape…and Otto stood blinking and running his hands over himself to check that he was all there. He caught sight of William and gave him the kind of big broad smile that only a vampire can give.

        “Mister Villiam! It vorked, your idea!”

        “Er…which one?” said William. A thin plume of yellow smoke was creeping out from under the lid of the big iconograph.

        “You said carry a little drop of emergency b-word,” said Otto. “Zo I thought: if it is in a little bottle around my neck, zen if I crumble to dust, hoopla! It vill crash and smash unt here I am!”

        He lifted the lid of the iconograph and waved the smoke away. There was the sound of very small coughing from within. “And if I am not mistaken, ve have a successfully etched picture! All of vhich only goes to show vot ve can achieve when our brains are not clouded by thoughts of open vindows and bare necks, vhich never cross my mind at all zese days because I am completely beetotal.”

        Otto had made changes to his clothing. Away had gone the traditional black evening dress preferred by his species, to be replaced by an armless vest containing more pockets than William had ever seen on one garment. Many of them were stuffed with packets of imp food, extra paint, mysterious tools, and other essentials of the iconographer’s art.

        In deference to tradition, though, Otto had made it black, with a red silk lining, and added tails.

        On making gentle inquiries of a family watching disconsolately as the smoke from the fire was turned to steam, William ascertained that the blaze had been mysteriously caused by mysterious spontaneous combustion in an overflowing mysterious chip pan full of boiling fat.

        William left them picking through the blackened remains of their home.

        “And it’s just a story,” he said, putting the notebook away. “It does makes me feel a bit of a vampire—oh…sorry.”

        “It is okay,” said Otto. “I understand. And I should like to thank you for givink me zis job. It means a lot to me, especially since I can see how nervous you are. Vhich is understandable, of course.”

        “I’m not nervous! I’m very much at home with other species!” said William hotly.

        Otto’s expression was amicable, but it was also as penetrative as the smile of a vampire can be.

        “Yes, I notice how careful you are to be friendly with the dwarfs and you are kind to me, also. It is a big effort vhich is very commendable—”

        William opened his mouth to protest, and gave up. “All right, look, it’s the way I was brought up, all right? My father was definitely very…in favor of humanity, well, ha, not humanity in the sense of…I mean, it was more that he was against—”

        “Yes, yes, I understand.”

        “And that’s all there is to it, okay? We can all decide who we’re going to be!”

        “Yes, yes, sure. And if you vant any advice about vimmin, you only have to ask.”

        “Why should I want advice about vi—women?”

        “Oh, no reason. No reason at all,” said Otto innocently.

        “Anyway, you’re a vampire. **What advice could a vampire give me about women?**”

        “Oh, my vord, vake up and smell zer garlic! Oh, zer stories I could tell you”—Otto paused—“but I von’t because I don’t do zat sort of thing anymore, now zat I have seen the daylight.” He nudged William, who was red with embarrassment. “Let us just say, zey don’t alvays scream.”

        “That’s a bit tasteless, isn’t it?”

        “Oh, that vas in zer bad old days,” said Otto hurriedly. “Now I like nothing better than a nice mug of cocoa and a good singsong around zer harmonium, I assure you. Oh, yes. My vord.”

        Sacharissa had pulled herself together, perhaps because no one was trying to comfort her anymore.

        “What are we going to do now?” she said.

        “I don’t know. Get a paper out, I suppose. That’s our job.”

        “But what happens if those men come back?”

        “I don’t think they will. This place is being watched now.”

        Sacharissa started to pick papers up off the floor. “I suppose I’ll feel better if I do something…”

        “That’s the spirit.”

        “If you can give me a few paragraphs about that fire…”

        “Otto got a decent picture,” said William. “Didn’t you, Otto?”

        “Oh yes. That vun is okay. But…”

        The vampire was staring down at his iconograph. It was smashed.

        “Oh, I’m so sorry,” said William.

        “I have ozzers.” Otto sighed. “You know, I thought it vould be easy in zer big city,” he said. “I thought it would be civilized. Zey told me mobs don’t come after you viz pitchforks in zer big city like zey do back in Schüschien. I mean, I try. Gods know I try. Three months, four days, and seven hours on zer vagon. I give up zer whole thing! Even zer pale ladies viz the velvet basques vorn on zer outside and zer fetching black lace dresses and zose little tiny, you know, high-heeled boots, and zat vas a wrench, I don’t mind telling you…” He shook his head miserably, and stared at his ruined shirt. “And stuff all gets broken and now my best shirt is all covered viz…blood…covered viz red, red blood…rich dark blood…zer blood…covered with zer blood…zer blood…”

        “Quick!” said Sacharissa, pushing past William. “Mister Goodmountain, you hold his arms!” She waved at the dwarfs. “I was ready for this! Two of you hold his legs! Dozy, there’s a huge blutwurst in my desk drawer!”

        **“…Let me valk in sunshine, living not in vein…”** Otto crooned.

        “Oh, my gods, his eyes are glowing red!” said William. “What shall we do?”

        “We could try cutting his head off again?” said Boddony.

        “That was a very poor joke, Boddony,” Sacharissa snapped.

        “Joke? I was smiling?”

        Otto stood up, the cursing dwarfs hanging off his sparse frame.

        “Through thunderstorm and dreadful night, ve will carry on zer fight…”

        “He’s as strong as an ox!” said Goodmountain.

        “Hang on, maybe it would help if we joined in!” said Sacharissa. She fumbled in her bag and produced a slim blue pamphlet. “I picked this up this morning, from the mission in Abattoirs Lane. It’s their songbook! And”—she started to sniff again—“it’s so sad, it’s called ‘Walking in Sunshine’ and it’s so—”

        “You want us to have a singsong?” said Goodmountain, as the struggling Otto lifted him off the ground.

        “Just to give him moral support!” Sacharissa dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief. “You can see he’s trying to fight it! And he did lay down his life for us!”

        “Yes, but then he picked it up again!”

    Thief of Time:
      - |
        Death found Famine in a restaurant in Genua. He had a booth all to himself and was eating Duck and Dirty Rice.

        “Oh,” said Famine. “It’s you.”

        YES. WE MUST RIDE. YOU MUST HAVE GOT MY MESSAGE.

        “Pull up a chair,” Famine hissed. “They do a very good alligator sausage here.”

        I SAID, WE MUST RIDE.

        “Why?”

        Death sat down and explained. Famine listened, although he never stopped eating.

        “I see,” he said at last. “Thank you, but **I think I shall sit this one out.**”

        SIT IT OUT? YOU’RE A HORSEMAN!

        “Yes, of course. But what is my role here?”

        I BEG YOUR PARDON?

        “No famine appears to be involved, does it? A shortage of food per se? As such?”

        WELL, NO. NOT AS SUCH, OBVIOUSLY, BUT—

        “So I would, as it were, be turning up just to wave. No, thank you.”

        YOU USED TO RIDE OUT EVERY TIME, said Death accusingly.

        Famine waved a bone airily. “We had proper apocalypses in those days,” he said and sucked at the bone. “You could sink your teeth into them.”

        NEVERTHELESS, THIS IS THE END OF THE WORLD.

        Famine pushed his plate aside and opened the menu.

        “There are other worlds,” he said. “You’re too sentimental, Death. I’ve always said so.”

        Death drew himself up. Humans had created Famine, too. Oh, there had always been droughts and locusts, but for a really good famine, for fertile land to be turned into a dust bowl by stupidity and avarice, you needed humans. Famine was arrogant.

        I AM SORRY, Death said, TO HAVE TRESPASSED ON YOUR TIME.

        The line of sledges moved across the snow.

        "It's damn cold," said Caleb.

        "Feeling your age, are you?" said Boy Willie.

        "You're as old as you feel, I always say."

        "Whut?"

        "HE SAYS YOU'RE AS OLD AS YOU FEEL, HAMISH!"

        "Whut? Feelin' whut?"

        "Are you sure Cohen's all right in the head?" said Evil Harry, as he helped Boy Willie manoeuvre Hamish's wheelchair over the ice.

        "'Ere, are you tryin' to spread discontent among the troops, Harry?"

        “I really don’t know why I listen to you, Lu-Tze, I really don’t,” said Qu. He glanced at the arena and hurriedly raised his megaphone to his lips. “Don’t hold it that way up! I said don’t hold—”

        There was a thunderclap. Lu-Tze didn’t bother to turn around.

        Qu lifted the megaphone again and said wearily, “All right, someone please go and fetch Brother Kai, will you? Start looking around, oh, two centuries ago. You don’t even use these very useful devices I, er, devise,” he added to Lu-Tze.

        “Don’t need to,” said Lu-Tze. “Got a brain. Anyway, I use the temporal toilet, don’t I?”

        “**A privy that discharges ten million years into the past was not a good idea, Sweeper.** I’m sorry I let you persuade me.”

        “It’s saving us fourpence a week to Harry King’s bucket boys, Qu, and that’s not to be sneezed at. Is it not written, ‘A penny saved is a penny earned?’ Besides, it all lands in a volcano anyway. Perfectly hygienic.”

        “For the sake of precision,” said Dr. Lawn, “let us say she’s a needlewoman. Apparently she heard there was a lot of work for seamstresses in the big city and had one or two amusing misunderstandings before someone told her exactly what was meant. One of them involved me removing a crochet hook from a man’s ear last week. Now she just hangs out with the rest of the girls.”

        “Why?”

        “Because she’s making a fortune, that’s why. Hasn’t it ever occurred to you, sergeant, that sometimes people go to a massage parlor for a real massage, for example? There’s ladies all over this city with discreet signs up that say things like ‘Trousers repaired while you wait,’ and a small but significant number of men make the same mistake as Sandra. There’s lot of men work here in the city and leave their wives back home and **sometimes, you know, a man feels these…urges. Like, for a sock without holes and a shirt with more than one button.** The ladies pass on the work. Apparently it’s quite hard to find a really good needlewoman in this city. They don’t like being confused with, er, seamstresses.”
