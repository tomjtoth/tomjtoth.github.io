        quote: |
          The sun crept over the horizon, decided to make a run for it, and began to rise.

          But it would be some time before its slow light rolled across the sleeping Disc, herding the night ahead of it, and nocturnal shadows still ruled the city.

          They clustered now around The Mended Drum in Filigree Street, foremost of the city’s taverns. It was famed not for its beer, which looked like maiden’s water and tasted like battery acid, but for its clientele. It was said that if you sat long enough in the Drum, then sooner or later every major hero on the Disc would steal your horse.

          The atmosphere inside was still loud with talk and heavy with smoke although the landlord was doing all those things landlords do when they think it’s time to close, like turn some of the lights out, wind up the clock, put a cloth over the pumps and, just in case, check the whereabouts of their club with the nails hammered in it. Not that the customers were taking the slightest bit of notice, of course. To most of the Drum’s clientele even the nailed club would have been considered a mere hint.

          However, they were sufficiently observant to be vaguely worried by the tall dark figure standing by the bar and drinking his way through its entire contents.

          Lonely, dedicated drinkers always generate a mental field which insures complete privacy, but this particular one was radiating a kind of fatalistic gloom that was slowly emptying the bar.

          This didn’t worry the barman, because the lonely figure was engaged in a very expensive experiment.

          Every drinking place throughout the multiverse has them—those shelves of weirdly-shaped, sticky bottles that not only contain exotically-named liquid, which is often blue or green, but also odds and ends that bottles of real drink would never stoop to contain, such as whole fruits, bits of twig and, in extreme cases, small drowned lizards. No-one knows why barmen stock so many, since they all taste like treacle dissolved in turpentine. It has been speculated that they dream of a day when someone will walk in off the street unbidden and ask for a glass of Peach Corniche with A Hint Of Mint and overnight the place will become somewhere To Be Seen At.

          The stranger was working his way along the row.

          WHAT IS THAT GREEN ONE?

          The landlord peered at the label.

          “It says it’s Melon Brandy,” he said doubtfully. “It says it’s bottled by some monks to an ancient recipe,” he added.

          I WILL TRY IT.

          The man looked sideways at the empty glasses on the counter, some of them still containing bits of fruit salad, cherries on a stick and small paper umbrellas.

          “Are you sure you haven’t had enough?” he said. It worried him vaguely that he couldn’t seem to make out the stranger’s face.

          The glass, with its drink crystallizing out on the sides, disappeared into the hood and came out again empty.

          NO. WHAT IS THE YELLOW ONE WITH THE WASPS IN IT?

          “Spring Cordial, it says. Yes?”

          YES. AND THEN THE BLUE ONE WITH THE GOLD FLECKS.

          “Er. Old Overcoat?”

          YES. AND THEN THE SECOND ROW.

          “Which one did you have in mind?”

          ALL OF THEM.

          The stranger remained bolt upright, the glasses with their burdens of syrup and assorted vegetation disappearing into the hood on a production line basis.

          This is it, the landlord thought, this is style, this is where I buy a red jacket and maybe put some monkey nuts and a few gherkins on the counter, get a few mirrors around the place, replace the sawdust. He picked up a beer-soaked cloth and gave the woodwork a few enthusiastic wipes, speading the drips from the cordial glasses into a rainbow smear that took the varnish off. The last of the usual customers put on his hat and staggered out, muttering to himself.

          “I DON’T SEE THE POINT”, the stranger said.

          “Sorry?”

          WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN?

          “How many drinks have you had?”

          FORTY-SEVEN.

          “Just about anything, then,” said the barman and, because he knew his job and knew what was expected of him when people drank alone in the small hours, he started to polish a glass with the slops cloth and said, “Your lady thrown you out, has she?”

          PARDON?

          “Drowning your sorrows, are you?”

          I HAVE NO SORROWS.

          “No, of course not. Forget I mentioned it.” He gave the glass a few more wipes. “Just thought it helps to have someone to talk to,” he said.

          The stranger was silent for a moment, thinking. Then he said: YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME?

          “Yes. Sure. I’m a good listener.”

          NO ONE EVER WANTED TO TALK TO ME BEFORE.

          “That’s a shame.”

          THEY NEVER INVITE ME TO PARTIES, YOU KNOW.

          “Tch.”

          THEY ALL HATE ME. EVERYONE HATES ME. I DON’T HAVE A SINGLE FRIEND.

          “Everyone ought to have a friend,” said the barman sagely.

          I THINK—

          “Yes?”

          I THINK…I THINK I COULD BE FRIENDS WITH THE GREEN BOTTLE.

          The landlord slid the octagon-bottle along the counter. Death took it and tilted it over the glass. The liquid tinkled on the rim.

          YOU DRUNK I’M THINK, DON’T YOU?

          “I serve anyone who can stand upright best out of three,” said the landlord.

          YOURRRE ABSOROOTLY RIGHT. BUT I—

          The stranger paused, one declamatory finger in the air.

          WAS WHAT I SAYING?

          “You said I thought you were drunk.”

          AH. YES, BUT I CAN BE SHOBER ANY TIME I LIKE. THIS ISH AN EXPERIMENT. AND NOW I WOULD LIKES TO EXPERIMENT WITH THE ORANGE BRANDY AGAIN.

          The landlord sighed, and glanced at the clock. There was no doubt that he was making a lot of money, especially since the stranger didn’t seem inclined to worry about overcharging or short change. But it was getting late; in fact it was getting so late that it was getting early. There was also something about the solitary customer that unsettled him. People in The Mended Drum often drank as though there was no tomorrow, but this was the first time he’d actually felt they might be right.

          I MEAN, WHAT HAVE I GOT TO LOOK FORWARD TO? WHERE’S THE SENSE IN IT ALL? WHAT IS IT REALLY ALL ABOUT?

          “Can’t say, my friend. I expect you’ll feel better after a good night’s sleep.”

          SLEEP? SLEEP? I NEVER SLEEP. I’M WOSSNAME, PROVERBIAL FOR IT.

          “Everyone needs their sleep. Even me,” he hinted.

          THEY ALL HATE ME, YOU KNOW.

          “Yes, you said. But it’s a quarter to three.”

          The stranger turned unsteadily and looked around the silent room.

          THERE’S NO ONE IN THE PLACE BUT YOU AND I, he said.

          The landlord lifted up the flap and came around the bar, helping the stranger down from his stool.

          I HAVEN’T GOT A SINGLE FRIEND. EVEN CATS FIND ME AMUSING.

          A hand shot out and grabbed a bottle of Amanita Liquor before the man managed to propel its owner to the door, wondering how someone so thin could be so heavy.

          I DON’T HAVE TO BE DRUNK, I SAID. WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE TO BE DRUNK? IS IT FUN?

          “Helps them forget about life, old chap. Now just you lean there while I get the door open—”

          FORGET ABOUT LIFE. HA. HA.

          “You come back any time you like, y’hear?”

          YOU’D REALLY LIKE TO SEE ME AGAIN?

          The landlord looked back at the small heap of coins on the bar. That was worth a little weirdness. At least this one was a quiet one, and seemed to be harmless.

          “Oh, yes,” he said, propelling the stranger into the street and retrieving the bottle in one smooth movement. “Drop in anytime.”

          THAT’S THE NICEHEST THING—

          **The door slammed on the rest of the sentence.**

        “This is Ankh-Morpork,” he said. “Anyone ought to be able to see that. Smell it, too.”

        Mort sniffed. There was a certain something about the air in the city. You got the feeling that it was air that had seen life. You couldn’t help noting with every breath that **thousands of other people were very close to you and nearly all of them had armpits.**

          “Er, excuse me,” said Cutwell, holding his hat respectfully, Mexican fashion.

          WELL? said Death, distracted.

          “It isn’t, sir. You must be thinking about another face.”

          WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

          “Cutwell, sir. I’m a wizard, sir.”

          I’M A WIZARD, SIR, Death sneered. BE SILENT, WIZARD.

          “Sir.” Cutwell stepped back.

          Death turned to Ysabell.

          DAUGHTER, EXPLAIN YOURSELF. WHY DID YOU AID THIS FOOL?

          Ysabell curtsied nervously.

          “I—love him, Father. I think.”

          “You do?” said Mort, astonished. “You never said!”

          “There didn’t seem to be time,” said Ysabell. “Father, he didn’t mean—”

          BE SILENT.

          Ysabell dropped her gaze. “Yes, Father.”

          Death stalked around the desk until he was standing directly in front of Mort. He stared at him for a long time.

          Then in one blurred movement his hand struck Mort across the face, knocking him off his feet.

          I INVITE YOU INTO MY HOME, he Said, I TRAIN YOU, I FEED YOU, I CLOTHE YOU, I GIVE YOU OPPORTUNITIES YOU COULD NOT DREAM OF, AND THUS YOU REPAY ME. YOU SEDUCE MY DAUGHTER FROM ME, YOU NEGLECT THE DUTY, YOU MAKE RIPPLES IN REALITY THAT WILL TAKE A CENTURY TO HEAL. YOUR ILL-TIMED ACTIONS HAVE DOOMED YOUR COMRADES TO OBLIVION. THE GODS WILL DEMAND NOTHING LESS.

          ALL IN ALL, BOY, **NOT A GOOD START TO YOUR FIRST JOB.**

        Rincewind pulled off his hat. It was battered, stained and covered with rock dust, bits of it had been sheared off, the point was dented and the star was shedding sequins like pollen, but the word ‘Wizzard’ was still just readable under the grime.

        “See this?” he demanded, red in the face. “Do you see it? Do you? What does it tell you?”

        “That **you can’t spell?**” said Nijel.

        “Your people are pretty rich, then?” said Chidder, ambling along beside him.

        Teppic thought about this. “No, not really,” he said. “They mainly grow melons and garlic and that kind of thing. And stand in the streets and shout ‘hurrah.’”

        “This is your parents you’re talking about?” said Chidder, puzzled.

        **“Oh, them? No, my father’s a pharaoh. My mother was a concubine, I think.”**

        “I thought that was some sort of vegetable.”

        “I don’t think so. We’ve never really discussed it. Anyway, she died when I was young.”

        “How dreadful,” said Chidder cheerfully.

        “She went for a moonlight swim in what turned out to be a crocodile.” Teppic tried politely not to be hurt at the boy’s reaction.

        “Our stars are entwined,” said Casanunda. “We’re fated for one another. I wants your body, Mrs. Ogg.”

        “I’m still using it.”

        And while she suspected, quite accurately, that this was an approach **the world’s second greatest lover** used on anything that appeared to be even vaguely female, Nanny Ogg had to admit that she was flattered.

        “Philosophers have right of way,” said the soldier.

        **“What’s a philosopher?”** said Brutha.

        “Someone who’s bright enough to find a job with no heavy lifting,” said a voice in his head.

    Men at arms:

        quote: |
          Cuddy and Detritus were proceeding along Phedre Road. It was lined with tanneries and brick kilns and timber yards and was not generally considered a beauty spot which was why, Cuddy suspected, they’d been given it to patrol “to get to know the city”. It got them out of the way. Sergeant Colon thought they made the place look untidy.

          There was no sound but the clink of his boots and the thump of Detritus’ knuckles on the ground.

          Finally, Cuddy said: “I just want you to know that I don’t like being teamed up with you any more than you like being teamed up with me.”

          “Right!”

          “But if we’re going to have to make the best of it, there’d better be some changes, OK?”

          “Like what?”

          “Like **it’s ridiculous you not even being able to count.** I know trolls can count. Why can’t you?”

          “Can count!”

          “How many fingers am I holding up, then?”

          Detritus squinted.

          “Two?”

          “OK. Now how many fingers am I holding up?”

          “Two…and one more…”

          “So two and one more is…?”

          Detritus looked panicky. This was calculus territory.

          “Two and one more is three.”

          “Two and one more is three.”

          “Now how many?”

          “Two and two.”

          “That’s four.”

          “Four-er.”

          “Now how many?”

          Cuddy tried eight fingers.

          “A twofour.”

          Cuddy looked surprised. He’d expected “many”, or possibly “lots”.

          “What’s a twofour?”

          “A two and a two and a two and a two.”

          Cuddy put his head on one side.

          “Hmm,” he said. “OK. A twofour is what we call an eight.”

          “Ate.”

          “You know,” said Cuddy, subjecting the troll to a long critical stare, “you might not be as stupid as you look. This is not hard. Let’s think about this. I mean…I’ll think about this, and you can join in when you know the words.”

          Anyone strolling along Phedre Road might have seen a troll and a dwarf apparently shouting at one another in excitement.

          “A two-thirtytwo, and eight, and a one!”

          “See? How many bricks in that pile?”

          Pause.

          “A sixteen, an eight, a four, a one!”

          “Remember what I said about dividing by eight-and-two?”

          Longer pause.

          “Two-enty-nine…?”

          “Right!”

          “Right!”

          “You can get there!”

          “I can get there!”

          “You’re a natural at counting to two!”

          “I’m a nat’ral at counting to two!”

          “If you can count to two, you can count to anything!”

          “If I can count to two, I can count to anything!”

          “And then the world is your mollusc!”

          **“My mollusc! What’s a mollusc?”**

          Cuddy opened his eyes.

          “You’re alive?” said Detritus.

          The dwarf gingerly removed his helmet. There was a gouge in the rim, and his head ached.

          “It looks like a mild skin abrasion,” said Detritus.

          “A what? Ooooh.” Cuddy grimaced. “What about you, anyway?” he said. There was something odd about the troll. It hadn’t quite dawned on him what it was, but there was definitely something unfamiliar, quite apart from all the holes.

          “I suppose the armor was some help,” said Detritus. He pulled at the straps of his breastplate. Five discs of metal slid out at around belt level. “If it hadn’t slowed them down I’d be seriously abraded.”

          “What’s up with you? Why are you talking like that?”

          “Like what, pray?”

          “What happened to the ‘me big troll’ talk? No offense meant.”

          “I’m not sure I understand.”

          Cuddy shivered, and stamped his feet to keep warm.

          “Let’s get out of here.”

          They trotted to the door. It was shut fast.

          “Can you knock it down?”

          “No. If this place wasn’t troll proof, it’d be empty. Sorry.”

          “Detritus?”

          “Yes?”

          “Are you all right? Only there’s steam coming off your head.”

          “I do feel…er…”

          Detritus blinked. There was a tinkle of falling ice. Odd things were happening in his skull.

          Thoughts that normally ambulated sluggishly around his brain were suddenly springing into vibrant, coruscating life. And there seemed to be more and more of them.

          “My goodness,” he said, to no one in particular.

          This was a sufficiently un-troll-like comment that even Cuddy, whose extremities were already going numb, stared at him.

          “I do believe,” said Detritus, “that I am genuinely cogitating. How very interesting!”

          “What do you mean?”

          More ice cascaded off Detritus as he rubbed his head.

          “Of course!” he said, holding up a giant finger. **“Superconductivity!”**

          “Wha’?”

          “You see? Brain of impure silicon. Problem of heat dissipation. Daytime temperature too hot, processing speed slows down, weather gets hotter, brain stops completely, trolls turn to stone until nightfall, ie, coldertemperature, however, lowertemperature-enough, brainoperates faster and—”

          “I think I’m going to freeze to death soon,” said Cuddy.

          Detritus looked around.

          “There are small glazed apertures up there,” he said.

          “Too hi’ to rea’, e’en if I st’ on y’shoulders,” mumbled Cuddy, slumping down further.

          “Ah, but my plan involves throwing something through them to attract help,” said Detritus.

          “Wha’ pla’?”

          “I have in fact eventuated twenty-three but this one has a ninety-seven percent chance of success,” said Detritus, beaming.

          “Ha’nt got an’ting t’throw,” said Cuddy.

          “I have,” said Detritus, scooping him up. “Do not worry. I can compute your trajectory with astonishing precision. And then all you will need to do is fetch Captain Vimes or Carrot or someone.”

          Cuddy’s feeble protests described an arc through the freezing air and vanished along with the window glass.

          Detritus sat down again. Life was so simple, when you really thought about it. And he was really thinking.

          He was seventy-six percent sure he was going to get at least seven degrees colder.

          Detritus sat and steamed. Now he felt hungry—not for food, but for things to think about. As the temperature sank, the efficiency of his brain increased even more. It needed something to do.

          He calculated the number of bricks in the wall, first in twos and then in tens and finally in sixteens. The numbers formed up and marched past his brain in terrified obedience. Division and multiplication were discovered. Algebra was invented and provided an interesting diversion for a minute or two. And then he felt the fog of numbers drift away, and looked up and saw the sparkling, distant mountains of calculus.

          Trolls evolved in high, rocky and above all in cold places. Their silicon brains were used to operating at low temperatures. But down on the muggy plains the heat build-up slowed them down and made them dull. It wasn’t that only stupid trolls came down to the city. Trolls who decided to come down to the city were often quite smart—but they became stupid.

          Detritus was considered moronic even by city troll standards. But that was simply because his brain was naturally optimized for a temperature seldom reached in Ankh-Morpork even during the coldest winter…

          Now his brain was nearing its ideal temperature of operation. Unfortunately, this was pretty close to a troll’s optimum point of death.

          Part of his brain gave some thought to this. There was a high probability of rescue. That meant he’d have to leave. That meant he’d become stupid again, as sure as 

          10<sup>-3</sup> (M <sub>c</sub> / M<sub>p</sub>) &alpha;<sup>&sigma;</sup> &alpha; <sup>G</sup> - <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> N = 10N

          **Better make the most of it**, then.

          He went back to the world of numbers so complex that they had no meaning, only a transitional point of view. And got on with freezing to death, as well.

          There was quite a crowd around them when they finally got the main door open. Lumps of ice clinked on the stones, and there was a rush of supercold air.

          Frost covered the floor and the rows of hanging carcasses on their backward journey through time. It also covered a Detritus-shaped lump squatting in the middle of the floor.

          They carried it out into the sunlight.

          “Should his eyes be flashing on and off like that?” said Dibbler.

          “Can you hear me?” shouted Cuddy. “Detritus?”

          Detritus blinked. Ice slid off him in the day’s heat.

          He could feel the cracking up of the marvelous universe of numbers. The rising temperature hit his thoughts **like a flame-thrower caressing a snowflake.**

          “Say something!” said Cuddy.

          Towers of intellect collapsed as the fire roared through Detritus’ brain.

          “Hey, look at this,” said one of the apprentices.

          The inner walls of the warehouse were covered with numbers. Equations as complex as a neural network had been scraped in the frost. At some point in the calculation the mathematician had changed from using numbers to using letters, and then letters themselves hadn’t been sufficient; brackets like cages enclosed expressions which were to normal mathematics what a city is to a map.

          They got simpler as the goal neared—simpler, yet containing in the flowing lines of their simplicity a spartan and wonderful complexity.

          Cuddy stared at them. He knew he’d never be able to understand them in a hundred years.

          The frost crumbled in the warmer air.

          The equations narrowed as they were carried on down the wall and across the floor to where the troll had been sitting, until they became just a few expressions that appeared to move and sparkle with a life of their own. This was maths without numbers, pure as lightning.

          They narrowed to a point, and at the point was just the very simple symbol: “=”.

          “Equals what?” said Cuddy. “Equals what?”

          The frost collapsed.

          Cuddy went outside. Detritus was now sitting in a puddle of water, surrounded by a crowd of human onlookers.

          “Can’t one of you get him a blanket or something?” he said.

          A very fat man said, “Huh? Who’d use a blanket after it had been on a troll?”

          “Hah, yes, good point,” said Cuddy. He glanced at the five holes in Detritus’ breastplate. They were at about head height, for a dwarf. “Could you come over here for moment, please?”

          The man grinned at his friends, and sauntered over.

          “I expect you can see the holes in his armor, right?” said Cuddy.

          C. M. O. T. Dibbler was a survivor. In the same way that rodents and insects can sense an earthquake ahead of the first tremors, so he could tell if something big was about to go down on the street. Cuddy was being too nice. When a dwarf was nice like that, it meant he was saving up to be nasty later on.

          “I’ll just, er, go about my business, then,” he said, and backed away.

          “I’ve got nothing against dwarfs, mind you,” said the fat man. “I mean, dwarfs is practically people, in my book. Just shorter humans, almost. But trolls…weeeelll…they’re not the same as us, right?”

          “’scuse me, ’scuse me, gangway, gangway,” said Dibbler, achieving with his cart the kind of getaway customarily associated with vehicles that have fluffy dice on the windscreen.

          “That’s a nice coat you’ve got there,” said Cuddy.

          Dibbler’s cart went around the corner on one wheel.

          “It’s a nice coat,” said Cuddy. “You know what you should do with a coat like that?”

          The man’s forehead wrinkled.

          “Take it off right now,” said Cuddy, “and give it to the troll.”

          “Why, you little—”

          The man grabbed Cuddy by his shirt and wrenched him upward.

          The dwarf’s hand moved very quickly. There was a scrape of metal.

          Man and dwarf made an interesting and absolute stationary tableau for a few seconds.

          Cuddy had been brought up almost level with the man’s face, and watched with interest as the eyes began to water.

          “Let me down,” said Cuddy. “Gently. I make involuntary muscle movements if I’m startled.”

          The man did so.

          “Now take off your coat…good…just pass it over…thank you…”

          “Your axe…” the man murmured.

          “Axe? Axe? My axe?” Cuddy looked down. “Well, well, well. Hardly knew I was holding it there. My axe. Well, there’s a thing.”

          The man was trying to stand on tiptoe. His eyes were watering.

          “The thing about this axe,” said Cuddy, “the interesting thing, is that it’s a throwing axe. I was champion three years running up at Copperhead. I could draw it and split a twig thirty yards away in one second. Behind me. And I was ill that day. A bilious attack.”

          He backed away. The man sank gratefully on to his heels.

          Cuddy draped the coat over the troll’s shoulders.

          “Come on, on your feet,” he said. “Let’s get you home.”

          The troll lumbered upright.

          “How many fingers am I holding up?” said Cuddy.

          Detritus peered.

          “Two and one?” he suggested.

          “It’ll do,” said Cuddy. “For a start.”

        “In fact, I wanted to see you about one of the students, Master,” he said coldly.

        “Students?” barked the Archchancellor.

        The Silver Horde wandered through the alleys of Hunghung.

        “I don’t call this bloody well sweeping through a city, slaughtering every bugger,” muttered Truckle. “When I was riding with Bruce the Hoon, we never walked in through a front gate like a bunch of soppy mother—”

        “Mr. Uncivil,” said Mr. Saveloy hurriedly, “I wonder if this might be a good time to refer you to that list I drew up for you?”

        “What bloody list?” said Truckle, sticking out his jaw belligerently.

        “The list of acceptable civilized words, yes?” He turned to the others. “Remember I was telling you about civ-il-ized be-hav-ior. Civilized behavior is vital to our long-term strategy.”

        “What’s a long-term strategy?” said Caleb the Ripper.

        “It’s what we’re going to do later,” said Cohen.

        “And what’s that, then?”

        “It’s the Plan,” said Cohen.

        “Well, I’ll be f—” Truckle began.

        “The list, Mr. Uncivil, only the words on the list,” snapped Mr. Saveloy. “Listen, I bow to your expertise when it comes to crossing wilderness, but this is civilization and you must use the right words. Please?”

        “Better do what he says, Truckle,” said Cohen.

        With bad grace, Truckle fished a grubby piece of paper out of his pocket and unfolded it.

        “‘Dang’?” he said. “Wassat mean? And what’s this ‘darn’ and ‘heck’?”

        “They are…civilized swearwords,” said Mr. Saveloy.

        “Well, you can take ’em and—”

        “Ah?” said Mr. Saveloy, raising a cautionary finger.

        “You can shove them up—”

        “Ah?”

        “You can—”

        “Ah?”

        Truckle shut his eyes and clenched his fists.

        “Dang it all to heck!” he shouted.

        “Good,” said Mr. Saveloy. “That’s much better.”

        He turned to Cohen, who was grinning happily at Truckle’s discomfort.

        “Cohen,” he said, “there’s an apple stall over there. Do you fancy an apple?”

        “Yeah, might do,” Cohen conceded, in the cautious manner of someone giving a conjuror his watch while remaining aware that the man is grinning and holding a hammer.

        “Right. Now, then, cla—I mean, gentlemen. Ghenghiz wants an apple. There’s a stall over there selling fruit and nuts. What does he do?” Mr. Saveloy looked hopefully at his charges. “Anyone? Yes?”

        “Easy. You kill that little”—there was a rustle of unfolding paper again—“chap behind the stall, then—”

        “No, Mr. Uncivil. Anyone else?”

        “Whut?”

        “You set fire to—”

        “No, Mr. Vincent. Anyone else…?”

        “You rape—”

        “No, no, Mr. Ripper,” said Mr. Saveloy. “We take out some muh—muh—?” He looked at them expectantly.

        “—money—” chorused the Horde.

        “—and we…What do we do? Now, we’ve gone through this hundreds of times. We…”

        This was the difficult bit. The Horde’s lined faces creased and puckered still further as they tried to force their minds out of the chasms of habit.

        “Gi…?” said Cohen hesitantly. Mr. Saveloy gave him a big smile and a nod of encouragement.

        “Give?…it…to…” Cohen’s lips tensed around the word “…him?”

        “Yes! Well done. In exchange for the apple. We’ll talk about making change and saying ‘thank you’ later on, when you’re ready for it. Now then, Cohen, here’s the coin. Off you go.”

        Cohen wiped his forehead. He was beginning to sweat.

        “How about if I just cut him up a bit—”

        “No! This is civilization.”

        Cohen nodded uncomfortably. He threw back his shoulders and walked over to the stall, where the apple merchant, who had been eying the group suspiciously, nodded at him.

        Cohen’s eyes glazed and his lips moved silently, as if he were rehearsing a script. Then he said:

        “Ho, fat merchant, give me all your…one apple…and I will give you…this coin…”

        He looked around. Mr. Saveloy had his thumb up.

        “You want an apple, is that it?” said the apple merchant.

        “Yes!”

        The apple merchant selected one. Cohen’s sword had been hidden in the wheelchair again but the merchant, in response to some buried acknowledgement, made sure it was a good apple. Then he took the coin. This proved a little difficult, since his customer seemed loath to let go of it.

        “Come on, hand it over, venerable one,” he said.

        Seven crowded seconds passed.

        Then, when they were safely around the corner, Mr. Saveloy said, “Now, everyone: who can tell me what Ghenghiz did wrong?”

        “Didn’t say please?”

        “Whut?”

        “No.”

        “Didn’t say thank you?”

        “Whut?”

        “No.”

        “Hit the man over the head with a melon and thumped him into the strawberries and kicked him in the nuts and set fire to his stall and stole all the money?”

        “Whut?”

        “Correct!” Mr. Saveloy sighed. “Ghenghiz, you were doing so well up to then.”

        “He didn’t ort to have called me what he did!”

        “But ‘venerable’ means old and wise, Ghenghiz.”

        “Oh. Does it?”

        “Yes.”

        “We-ell…I did leave him the money for the apple.”

        “Yes, but, you see, I do believe you took all his other money.”

        “But I paid for the apple,” said Cohen, rather testily.

        Mr. Saveloy sighed. “Ghenghiz, I do rather get the impression that several thousand years of the patient development of fiscal propriety have somewhat passed you by.”

        “Come again?”

        “It is possible sometimes for money to legitimately belong to other people,” said Mr. Saveloy patiently.

        The Horde paused to wrap their minds around this, too. It was, of course, something they knew to be true in theory. Merchants always had money. But it seemed wrong to think of it as belonging to them; it belonged to whoever took it off them. Merchants didn’t actually own it, they were just looking after it until it was needed.

        “Now, there is an elderly lady over there selling ducks,” said Mr. Saveloy. “I think the next stage—Mr. Willie, I am not over there, I am sure whatever you are looking at is very interesting, but please pay attention—is to practice our grasp of social intercourse.”

        “Hur, hur, hur,” said Caleb the Ripper.

        “I mean, Mr. Ripper, that you should go and enquire how much it would be for a duck,” said Mr. Saveloy.

        “Hur, hur, hur—What?”

        “And you are not to rip all her clothes off. That’s not civilized.”

        Caleb scratched his head. Flakes fell out.

        “Well, what else am I supposed to do?”

        “Er…engage her in conversation.”

        “Eh? What’s there to talk about with a woman?”

        Mr. Saveloy hesitated again. To some extent this was unknown territory to him as well. His experience with women at his last school had been limited to an occasional chat with the housekeeper, and on one occasion the matron had let him put his hand on her knee. He had been forty before he found out that oral sex didn’t mean talking about it. Women had always been to him strange and distant and wonderful creatures rather than, as the Horde to a man believed, something to do. He was struggling a little.

        “The weather?” he hazarded. His memory threw in vague recollections of the staple conversation of the maiden aunt who had brought him up. “Her health? The trouble with young people today?”

        “And then I rip her clothes off?”

        “Possibly. Eventually. If she wants you to. I might draw your attention to the discussion we had the other day about **taking regular baths**”—or even a bath, he added to himself—“and attention to fingernails and hair and changing your clothes more often.”

        “This is leather,” said Caleb. “You don’t have to change it, it don’t rot for years.”

        Once again Mr. Saveloy readjusted his sights. He’d thought that Civilization could be overlaid on the Horde like a veneer. He had been mistaken.

    Feet of clay:

        quote: |
          “Well? What do you want at this time of night?”

          The golem handed him a slate, on which was written:

          **WE HEAR YOU WANT A GOLEM.**

          Of course, golems couldn’t speak, could they?

          “Hah. Want, yes. Afford, no. I’ve been asking around but it’s wicked the prices you’re going for these days…”

          The golem rubbed the words off the slate and wrote:

          TO YOU, ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS.

          “You’re for sale?”

          NO.

          The golem lurched aside. Another one stepped into the light.

          It was also a golem, the man could see that. But it wasn’t like the usual lumpen clay things that you occasionally saw. This one gleamed like a newly polished statue, perfect down to the detailing of the clothes. It reminded him of one of the old pictures of the city’s kings, all haughty stance and imperious haircut. In fact, it even had a small coronet molded on to its head.

          “A hundred dollars?” the man said suspiciously. “What’s wrong with it? Who selling it?”

          NOTHING IS WRONG. PERFECT IN ALL DETAIL. NINETY DOLLARS.

          “Sounds like someone wants to get rid of it in a hurry…”

          GOLEM MUST WORK. GOLEM MUST HAVE A MASTER.

          “Yeah, right, but you hear stories…Going mad and making too many things, and that.”

          NOT MAD. EIGHTY DOLLARS.

          “It looks…new,” said the man, tapping the gleaming chest. “But no one’s making golems any more, that’s what’s keeping the price up beyond the purse of the small business—” He stopped. “Is someone making them again?”

          EIGHTY DOLLARS.

          “I heard the priests banned making ’em years ago. A man could get in a lot of trouble.”

          SEVENTY DOLLARS.

          “Who’s doing it?”

          SIXTY DOLLARS.

          “Is he selling them to Albertson? Or Spadger and Williams? It’s hard enough competing as it is, and they’ve got the money to invest in new plant—”

          FIFTY DOLLARS.

          The man walked around the golem. “A man can’t sit by and watch his company collapse under him because of unfair price cutting, I mean to say…”

          FORTY DOLLARS.

          “Religion is all very well, but what do prophets know about profits, eh? Hmm…” He looked up at the shapeless golem in the shadows. “Was that thirty dollars I just saw you write?”

          YES.

          “I’ve always liked dealing wholesale. Wait one moment.” He went back inside and returned with a handful of coins. “Will you be selling any to them other bastards?”

          NO.

          “Good. Tell your boss it’s a pleasure to do business with him. Get along inside, Sunny Jim.”

      - Colon managed to peer down through **the small and smelly space** between the wall and his armpit.

    Hogfather:
      - “And don’t forget the presents,” said the Chair of Indefinite Studies, as if reading off some internal list of gloom. “How…how full of potential they seem in all that paper, how pregnant with possibilities…and then you open them and basically the wrapping paper was more interesting and you have to say ‘How thoughtful, that will come in handy.’ **It’s not better to give than to receive, in my opinion, it’s just less embarrassing.”**

      - Death lived in a black world, where nothing was alive and everything was dark and his great library only had dust and cobwebs because he’d created them for effect and there was never any sun in the sky and the air never moved and he had an umbrella stand. And a pair of silver-backed hairbrushes by his bed. He wanted to be something more than just a bony apparition. He tried to create these flashes of personality but somehow they betrayed themselves, they **tried too hard, like an adolescent boy going out wearing an after-shave called “Rampant.”**

        “Well, he’s for kids, isn’t he?” said the Dean. “But I’m sure they all believe in him. I certainly did. It wouldn’t be Hogswatch when I was a kid without a pillowcase hanging by the fire—”

        “A pillowcase?” said the Senior Wrangler, sharply.

        “Well, you can’t get much in a stocking,” said the Dean.

        “Yes, but a whole pillowcase?” the Senior Wrangler insisted.

        “Yes. What of it?”

        “Is it just me, or is that a rather greedy and selfish way to behave? In my family we just hung up very small socks,” said the Senior Wrangler. “A sugar pig, a toy soldier, a couple of oranges and that was it. Hah, turns out people with whole pillowcases were cornering the market, eh?”

        “Shut up and stop squabbling, both of you,” said Ridcully. “There must be a simple way to check up. How can you tell if the Hogfather exists?”

        “Someone’s drunk the sherry, there’s sooty footprints on the carpet, sleigh tracks on the roof and **your pillowcase is full of presents**,” said the Dean.

        The Senior Wrangler wasn’t attending the Feast. He got one of the maids to bring a tray up to his rooms, where he was Entertaining and doing all those things a man does when he finds himself unexpectedly tête-à-tête with the opposite sex, like trying to shine his boots on his trousers and clean his fingernails with his other fingernails.

        “A little more wine, Gwendoline? It’s hardly alcoholic,” he said, leaning over her.

        “I don’t mind if I do, Mr. Wrangler.”

        “Oh, call me Horace, please. And perhaps a little something for your chicken?”

        “I’m afraid she seems to have wandered off somewhere,” said the Cheerful Fairy. “I’m afraid I’m, I’m, I’m rather dull company…” She blew her nose noisily.

        “Oh, I certainly wouldn’t say that,” said the Senior Wrangler. He wished he’d had time to tidy up his rooms a bit, or at least get some of the more embarrassing bits of laundry off the stuffed rhinoceros.

        “Everyone’s been so kind,” said the Cheerful Fairy, dabbing at her streaming eyes. “Who was the skinny one that kept making the funny faces for me?”

        “That was the Bursar. Why don’t you—”

        “He seemed very cheerful, anyway.”

        “It’s the dried frog pills, he eats them by the handful,” said the Senior Wrangler dismissively. “I say, why don’t—”

        “Oh dear. I hope they’re not addictive.”

        “I’m sure he wouldn’t keep on eating them if they were addictive,” said the Senior Wrangler. “Now, why don’t you have another glass of wine, and then…and then…” a happy thought struck him “…and then…and then perhaps I could show you Archchancellor Bowell’s Remembrance? It’s got a-a-a-a very interesting ceiling. My word, yes.”

        “That would be very nice,” said the Cheerful Fairy. “Would it cheer me up, do you think?”

        “Oh, it would, it would,” said the Senior Wrangler. “Definitely! Good! So I’ll, er, I’ll just go and…just go and…I’ll…” He pointed vaguely in the direction of his dressing room, while hopping from one foot to the other. “I’ll just go and, er…go…just…”

        He fled into the dressing room and slammed the door behind him. His wild eyes scanned the shelves and hangers.

        “Clean robe,” he mumbled. “Comb face, wash socks, fresh hair, where’s that **Insteadofshave lotion**—”

        “Rather a lonely person, our Nobby,” said Carrot.

        “Well, yes…”

        “But I’m sure he’ll find the right person for him,” Carrot added, cheerfully.

        Probably in a bottle, said Angua to herself. She remembered the conversation with him. It was a terrible thing to think, but there was something itchy about the thought of **Nobby being allowed in the gene pool, even at the shallow end**.

      - |
        They looked up. Someone with a face and apron that said “barman” in seven hundred languages was standing over them, a wine jug in each hand.

        “No women in here,” he went on.

        “Why not?” said Nobby.

        “No women asking questions, neither.”

        “Why not?”

        “’cos it is written, that’s why.”

        “Where’m I supposed to go, then?”

        The barman shrugged. “Who knows where women go?”

        “Off you go, Beti,” said the Patrician. “And…listen for information!”

        Nobby grabbed the cup of wine from Colon and gulped it down.

        “I dunno,” he moaned, **“I’ve only been a woman ten minutes and already I hate you male bastards.”**

        MR. SLOPES?

        Snowy Slopes gingerly felt his neck, or at least the neck of his soul. The human soul tends to keep to the shape of the original body for some time after death. Habit is a wonderful thing.

        “Who the hell was he?” he said.

        NOT SOMEONE YOU KNOW? said Death.

        “Well, no! I don’t know many people who cut my head off!”

        Snowy Slopes’s body had knocked against the table as it fell. Several bottles of medicated shampoo now dripped and mixed their contents into the other more intimate fluids from the Slopes corpse.

        “That stuff with the special oil in it cost me nearly four dollars,” said Snowy. Yet, somehow, it all seemed slightly…irrelevant now. Death happens to other people. The other person in this case had been him. That is, the one down there. Not the one standing here looking at it. In life, Snowy hadn’t even been able to spell “metaphysical,” but he was already beginning to view life in a different way. From the outside, for a start.

        “Four dollars,” he repeated. “I never even had time to try it!”

        IT WOULDN’T HAVE WORKED, said Death, patting the man on a fading shoulder. BUT, IF I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT YOU LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, IT WILL NO LONGER BE NECESSARY.

        **“No more dandruff?”** said Snowy, now quite transparent and fading fast.

        EVER, said Death. TRUST ME ON THIS.

        …Also, we went to the bow shops in the Street of Cunning Artificers and showed the iconograph to the man in Burleigh and Stronginthearm, who vouchsafed, that is him, e.g., he was referring to the Diseased…

        “Oh, my…” Vimes’s lips moved slightly as his gaze went back up the page.

        …also in addition to the Klatchian money you could tell one of them had been there because of, e.g., the sand on the floor…

        “He’d still got sand in his sandals?” murmured Vimes. “Good grief.”

        “Sam?”

        Vimes looked up from his reading.

        “Your soup will be cold,” said Lady Sybil from the far end of the table. “You’ve been holding that spoonful in the air for the last five minutes by the clock.”

        “Sorry, dear.”

        “What are you reading?”

        “Oh, just a little masterpiece,” said Vimes, pushing Fred Colon’s report aside.

        “Interesting, is it?” said Lady Sybil a little sourly.

        “Practically unparalleled,” said Vimes. “The only things they haven’t found are the bunch of dates and the camel hidden under the pillow…”

        Belatedly, his nuptial radar detected a certain chilliness from the far side of the cruet.

        “Is, er, there something wrong, dear?” he said.

        “Can you remember when we last had dinner together, Sam?”

        “Tuesday, wasn’t it?”

        “That was the Guild of Merchants’ annual dinner, Sam.”

        Vimes’s brow wrinkled. “But you were there, too, weren’t you?”

        A further subtle change in the dragonhouse quotient told him that this was not a well chosen answer.

        “And then you rushed off afterward because of that business with the barber in Gleam Street.”

        “Sweeney Jones,” said Vimes. “Well, he was killing people, Sybil. The best you could say is that he didn’t mean to. **He was just very bad at shaving—”**

        “Amazin’ piece of work,” said Ridcully, emerging from the elephant. “Very good wheels. You paint these bits before assembly, do you?”

        “It’s not a kit, sir,” said Ponder, taking a kidney out of his hands and wedging it back in. “It’s a real elephant under construction!”

        “Oh.”

        “Being made, sir,” said Ponder, since Ridcully didn’t seem to have got the message. “Which is not usual.”

        “Ah. How are they normally made, then?”

        “By other elephants, sir.”

        “Oh, yes…”

        “Really? Are they?” said the god. “How? Those trunks are pretty nimble, even if I say so myself, but not really very good for delicate work.”

        “Oh, not made like that, sir, obviously. By…you know…sex…” said Ponder, feeling a blush start.

        “Sex?”

        Then Ponder thought: Mono Island. Oh dear…

        “Er…males and females…” he ventured.

        “What are they, then?” said the god. The wizards paused.

        “Do go on, Mister Stibbons,” said the Archchancellor. “We’re all ears. Especially the elephant.”

        “Well…” Ponder knew he was going red. “Er…well, how do you get flowers and things at the moment?”

        “I make them,” said the god. “And then I keep an eye on them and see how they function and then when they wear out I make an improved version based on experimental results.” He frowned. “Although the plants seem to be acting very oddly these days. What’s the point of these seeds they keep making? I try to discourage it but they don’t seem to listen.”

        **“I think…er…they’re trying to invent sex, sir,” said Ponder.** “Er…sex is how you can…they can…creatures can…they can make the next…creatures.”

        “You mean…elephants can make more elephants?”

        “Yes, sir.”

        “My word! Really?”

        “Oh, yes.”

        “How do they go about that? Calibrating the ear-waggling is particularly time-consuming. Do they use special tools?”

        Ponder saw that the Dean was staring straight up at the ceiling, while the other wizards were also finding something apparently fascinating to look at that meant they could avoid one another’s gaze.

        “Um, in a way,” said Ponder. He knew that a sticky patch lay ahead and decided to give up. “But really I don’t know much about—”

        “And workshops, presumably,” said the god. He took a book from his pocket and a pencil from behind his ear. “Do you mind if I make notes?”

        “They…er…the female…” Ponder tried.

        “Female,” said the god obediently, writing this down.

        “Well, she…one popular way…she…sort of makes the next one…inside her.”

        The god stopped writing. “Now I know that’s not right,” he said. “You can’t make an elephant inside an elephant—”

        “Er…a smaller version…”

        “Ah, once again I have to point out the flaw. After a few such constructions you’d end up with an elephant the size of a rabbit.”

        “Er, it gets bigger later…”

        “Really? How?”

        “It sort of…builds itself…er…from the inside…”

        “And the other one, the one that is not the, uh, female? What is its part in all this? Is your colleague ill?”

        The Senior Wrangler hammered the Dean hard on the back.

        “It’s all right,” squeaked the Dean, “…often have…these…coughing fits…”

        The god scribbled industriously for a few seconds, and then stopped and chewed the end of his pencil thoughtfully.

        “And all this, er, this sex is done by unskilled labor?” he said.

        “Oh, yes.”

        “No quality control of any description?”

        “Er, no.”

        “How does your species go about it?” said the god. He looked questioningly at Ponder.

        “It…er…we…er…” Ponder stuttered.

        “We avoid it,” said Ridcully. “Nasty cough you’ve got there, Dean.”
        “Really?” said the god. “That’s very interesting. What do you do instead? Split down the middle? That works beautifully for amoebas, but giraffes find it extremely difficult, I do know that.”

        “What? No, we concentrate on higher things,” said Ridcully. “And take cold baths, healthy morning runs, that sort of thing.”

        “My goodness, I’d better make a note of that,” said the god, patting his robe. “How does the process work, exactly? Do the females accompany you? These higher things…How high, precisely? This is a very interesting concept. Presumably extra orifices are required?”

        “What? Pardon?” said Ponder.

        “Getting creatures to make themselves, eh? I thought this whole seed business was just high spirits but, yes, I can see that it would save a lot of work, a lot of work. Of course, there’d have to be some extra effort at the design stage, certainly, but afterwards I suppose it’d practically run itself…” The god’s hand blurred as he wrote, and he went on, “Hmm, drives and imperatives, they’re going to be vital…er…How does it work with, say, trees?”

        “You just need Ponder’s uncle and a paintbrush,” said the Senior Wrangler.

        “Sir!” said Ponder hotly.

        The god gave them both a look of intelligent bewilderment, like a man who had just heard a joke told in a completely foreign language and isn’t sure if the speaker has got to the punch line yet. Then he shrugged.

        “The only thing I think I don’t quite understand,” he said, “is why any creature would want to spend time on all this…” he peered at his notes, “this sex, when they could be enjoying themselves…Oh dear, your associate seems to be choking this time, I’m afraid…”

        “Dean!” shouted Ridcully.

        “I can’t help noticing,” said the god, “that when sex is being discussed your faces redden and you tend to shift uneasily from one foot to the other. Is this some sort of signal?”

        “Erm…”

        “If you could just tell me how it all works…”

        Embarrassment filled the air, huge and pink. If it were rock, you could have carved great hidden rose-red cities in it.

        Ridcully smiled a petrified smile. “Excuse us,” he said. “Faculty meeting, gentlemen?”

        Ponder watched the wizards go into a huddle. He could hear a few phrases above the susurration.

        “…my father said, but of course I didn’t believe…never raised its ugly head…Dean, will you shut up? We can’t very well…cold showers, really…”

        Ridcully turned back and flashed the stony smile again. “Sex is, er, not something we talk about,” he said.

        “Much,” said the Dean.

        “Oh, I see,” said the god. “Well, a practical demonstration would be so much more comprehendible.”

        “Er, we weren’t, er…planning a…”

        “Coo-eee! There you are, gentlemen!”

        Mrs. Whitlow entered the cave. The wizards went suddenly quiet, sensing in their wizardly minds that the introduction of Mrs. Whitlow at this point was an electric fire in the swimming pool of life.

        “Oh, another one of you,” said the god brightly. He focused. “Or a different species, perhaps?”
        Ponder felt that he had to say something. Mrs. Whitlow was giving him a Look.

        “Mrs., er, Whitlow is, er, a lady,” he said.

        “Ah, I shall make a note of it,” said the god. “And what sort of thing do they do?”

        “They’re, um, the same species as, er, us,” said Ponder, miserably. Um…the…um…”

        “Weaker sex,” Ridcully supplied.

        “Sorry, you’ve lost me there,” said the god.

        “Er…she’s, um, er, a…of the female persuasion,” said Ponder.

        The god smiled happily. “Oh, how very convenient,” he said.

        “Excuse me” said Mrs. Whitlow, in as sharp a tone as she cared to use around the wizards, “but will someone introduce this gentleman to me?”

        “Oh, yes, of course,” said Ridcully. “Do excuse me. God, this is Mrs. Whitlow. Mrs. Whitlow, this is God. A god. God of this island, in fact. Uh…”

        “Charmed, Ai’m sure,” said Mrs. Whitlow. In Mrs. Whitlow’s book, gods were socially very acceptable, at least if they had proper human heads and wore clothes; they rated above High Priests and occupied the same level as Dukes.

        “Should Ai kneel?” she said.

        “Mwaaa,” whimpered the Senior Wrangler.

        “Genuflection of any sort is not required,” said the god.

        “He means no,” said Ponder.

        “Oh, as you wish,” said Mrs. Whitlow. She extended a hand.

        The god grasped it and waggled her thumb backwards and forward.

        “Very practical,” he said. “Opposable, I see. I think I should make a note of this. Do you brachiate? Are you bipedal by habit? Oh, I notice your eyebrows go up, too. Is this a signal of some sort? I also note that you are a different shape from the others and don’t have a beard. I assume that means you are less wise?”

        Ponder saw Mrs. Whitlow’s eyes narrow and her nostrils flare.

        “Is there some sort of problem, sirs?” she said. “Ai followed your footprints to that funny boat, and this was the only other path, so—”

        “We were discussing sex,” said the god enthusiastically. “It sounds very exciting, don’t you think?”

        The wizards held their breath. This was going to make the Dean’s sheets look very minor.

        “It’s not a subject on which Ai would venture an opinion,” said Mrs. Whitlow carefully.

        “Mwaa,” squeaked the Senior Wrangler.

        “No one seems to want to tell me,” said the god irritably. A spark leapt from his fingers and blew a very small crater in the floor, and that seemed to shock him as much as it did the wizards.

        “Oh dear, what can you think of me? I’m so sorry!” he said. “I’m afraid it’s a sort of natural reaction if I get a bit, you know…testy.”

        Everyone looked at the crater. The rock bubbled gently by Ponder’s feet. He didn’t dare move his sandal, just in case he fainted.

        “That was just…testy, was it?” said Ridcully.

        “Well, it may have been more…vexed, I suppose,” said the god. “I can’t really help it, it’s a god-given reflex. I’m afraid as a…well, species, we’re not good with, you know, defiance. I’m so sorry. So sorry.” He blew his nose, and sat down on a half-finished panda. “Oh, dear. There I go again…” A tiny bolt of lightning flashed off his thumb and exploded. “I hope it’s not going to be the city of Quint all over again. Of course, you know what happened there…”

        “I’ve never heard of the city of Quint,” said Ponder.

        “Yes, I suppose you wouldn’t have,” said the god. “That’s the whole point, really. It wasn’t much of a city. It was mostly made of mud. Well, I say mud. Afterwards, of course, it was mainly ceramics.” He turned a wretched face to them. “You know those days you get when you just snap at everyone?”

        Out of the corner of his eye Ponder had noticed that the wizards, in a rare show of unanimity, were shuffling sideways, very slowly, towards the door.

        A much bigger thunderbolt blew a hole in the floor near the cave entrance.

        “Oh dear, where can I put my face?” said the god. “It’s all subconscious, I’m afraid.”

        “Could you get treatment for premature incineration?”

        “Dean! This is not the time!”

        “Sorry, Archchancellor.”

        “If only they hadn’t turned up their noses at my inflammable cows,” said the god, sparks fizzing off his beard. “All right, I would agree that on hot days, in certain rare circumstances, they would spontaneously combust and burn down the village, but is that any excuse for ingratitude?”

        Mrs. Whitlow had been giving the god a long, cool stare. “What exactly is it you wish to know?” she said.

        “Huh?” said Ridcully.

        “Well, Ai mean no offense, but Ai for one would like to get out of here without mai hair on fire,” said the housekeeper.

        The god looked up. “This male and female concept seems really rather promising,” he said, sniffing. “But no one seems to want to go into detail…”

        “Oh, that,” said Mrs. Whitlow. She glanced at the wizards, and then gently pulled the god to his feet. “If you will excuse me for one moment, gentlemen…”

        The wizards watched them in even more shock than had attended the lightning display, and then the Chair of Indefinite Studies pulled his hat over his eyes.

        “I daren’t look,” he said, and added, “What are they doing?”

        “Er…just talking…” said Ponder.

        “Talking?”

        “And she’s…sort of…waving her hands about.”

        “Mwaa!” said the Senior Wrangler.

        “Quick, someone, give him some air,” said Ridcully. “Now she’s laughing, isn’t she?”

        Both the housekeeper and the god looked around at the wizards. Mrs. Whitlow nodded her head as if to reassure him that what she’d just told him was true, and they both laughed.

        “That looked more like a snigger,” said the Dean severely.

        “I’m not sure I actually approve of this,” said Ridcully, haughtily. “Gods and mortal women, you know. You hear stories.”

        “Gods turning themselves into bulls,” said the Dean.

        “Swans, too,” said the Chair of Indefinite Studies.

        “Showers of gold,” said the Dean.

        “Yes,” said the Chair. He paused for a second. “You know, I’ve often wondered about that one—”

        “What’s she describing now?”

        “I think I’d rather not know, quite frankly.”

        “Oh, look, someone please do something for the Senior Wrangler, will you?” said Ridcully. “Loosen his clothing or something!”

        They heard the god shout, “It what?” Mrs. Whitlow glanced around at the wizards and appeared to lower her voice.

        “Did anyone ever meet Mr. Whitlow?” said the Archchancellor.

        “Well…no,” said the Dean. “Not that I remember. I suppose we’ve all assumed that he’s dead.”

        “Anyone know what he died of?” Ridcully went on. “Ah, quieten down…they’re coming back…”

        The god nodded cheerfully at them as he approached.

        “Well, that’s all sorted out,” he said, rubbing his hands together. “I can’t wait to see how it works in practice. You know, if I’d sat here for a hundred years I’d never have…well, really, no one could serious believe…I mean…” He started to chuckle at their frozen faces. “That bit where he…and then she…Really, I’m amazed that anyone stops laughing long enough to…Still, I can see how it could work, and it certainly opens the door to some very interesting possibilities indeed…”

        Mrs. Whitlow was looking intently at the ceiling. There was perhaps just a hint in her stance and the way her rather expressive bosom moved that she was trying not to laugh. It was disconcerting. Mrs. Whitlow never usually laughed at anything.

        “Ah? Oh?” said Ridcully, edging towards the door. “Really? Well done, then. So, I expect you don’t need us any more, eh? Only we’ve got a boat to catch…”

        “Yes, certainly, don’t let me hold you up,” said the god, waving a hand vaguely. “You know, the more I think about it, the more I can see that ‘sex’ will solve practically all my problems.”

        “Not everyone can say that,” said Ridcully gravely. “Are you, er…joining us, Mrs., er, Whitlow?”

        “Certainly, Archchancellor.”

        “Er…jolly good. Well done. Ahem. And you, of course, Mister Stibbons…”

        “Nanny?”

        “Yes, luv?”

        “**Are there such things as blue mice?**”

        “**Not while you’re sober, dear.**”

        “I think…I’m owed a drink, then. Is there any brandy left?”

      - |
        “I think these really are new vampires,” said Agnes. “They really aren’t like the old sort.”

        “Then we face ’em here and now,” said Nanny. “That’s what Esme would do, sure enough.”

        “But are we strong enough?” said Agnes. Granny wouldn’t have asked, said Perdita.

        “There’s three of us, isn’t there?” said Nanny. She produced a flask, and uncorked it. “And a bit of help. Anyone else want some?”

        “That’s brandy, Nanny!” said Magrat. **“Do you want to face the vampires drunk?”**

        “Sounds a whole lot better than facin’ them sober,” said Nanny, taking a gulp and shuddering. “Only sensible bit of advice Agnes got from Mister Oats, I reckon. Vampire hunters need to be a little bit tipsy, he said. Well, I always listen to good advice…”

      - |
        “Things were simpler then,” said the Count. “And also very, very stupid.” He sighed. “Where the hell’s Igor?”

        “Ahem. I’ve been meaning to talk to you about him, dear,” said the Countess. “I think he’ll have to go.”

        “That’s right!” snapped Lacrimosa. “Honestly, even my friends laugh at him!’

        “I find his more-gothic-than-thou attitude extremely irritating,” said the Countess. “That stupid accent…and do you know what I found him doing in the old dungeons last week?”

        “I’m sure I couldn’t guess,” said the Count.

        “He had a **box of spiders and a whip! He was forcing them to make webs** all over the place.”

        “I wondered why there was always so many, I must admit,” said the Count.

    The Fifth Elephant:
      - |
        The fatter of the two hesitated, and then held out his hand.

        “Pisspot,” he said.

        “Inigo?” said Vimes quietly, without turning his head.

        “Ah,” said Inigo, after some muttered exchanges. “Now the problem seems to be Sergeant Detritus. No trolls are allowed in this part of town during the hours of daylight, apparently, without a passport signed by their…owner. Uh…in Bonk the only trolls allowed are prisoners of war. They have to carry identification.”

        “Detritus is a citizen of Ankh-Morpork and my sergeant,” said Vimes.

        “However, he is a troll. Perhaps in the interests of diplomacy you could write a short—”

        “Do I need a pisspot?”

        “A passport…no, Your Grace.”

        “Then he doesn’t, either.”

        “Nevertheless, Your Grace—”

        “There is no nevertheless.”

        “But it may be advisable to—”

        “There’s no advisable, either.”

        A few other guards had drifted over. Vimes was aware of watching eyes.

        “He could be ejected by force,” said Inigo.

        “Now there’s an experiment I wouldn’t want to miss,” said Vimes.

        Detritus made a rumbling noise. “I don’t mind goin’ back if—”

        **“Shut up, Sergeant. You’re a free troll. That’s an order.”**

      - |
        “People down there aren’t happy,” said Vimes. “That looks like a mob to me. Look, you can tell by the way they move…”

        “Commander Vimes?”

        He turned. In the gloom he could make out several dwarfs, each with a candle fixed to his helmet. In front of them was, presumably, another dwarf.

        He’d seen clothes like this in Ankh-Morpork, but always scurrying away. This was…a deep-down dwarf.

        It was wearing some sort of robe made of overlapping leather plates. Instead of the small round iron helmet which Vimes had always thought dwarfs were born with, it had a pointed leather hat with more leather flaps all around it. The one at the front had been tied up, to allow the wearer to look out at the world, or at least that part of it that was underground. The general effect was of a mobile cone.

        “Er…yes, that’s me,” said Vimes.

        “Welcome to Shmaltzberg, Your Excellency. I am the king’s jar’ahk’haga, which in your language you would call—”

        But Vimes’s lips had been moving fast as he tried to translate.

        “Ideas…taster?” he said.

        “Hah! That would be a way of putting it, yes. My name…is Dee. Would you care to follow me? This should not take long.”

        The figure swept away. One of the other dwarfs prodded Vimes very gently, indicating that he should follow.

        The sound from far below redoubled. Someone was yelling.

        “Is there some problem?” said Vimes, catching up with the fast-moving Dee.

        “We have no problems.”

        Ah, **he’s already lied to me**, thought Vimes. **We’re being diplomatic.**

      - |
        “Your Grace!”

        Dee was advancing through the crowds.

        “Ah, Ideas-taster,” said Vimes. as the dwarf approached, “do allow me to introduce the Duchess of Ankh-Morpork…Lady Sybil.”

        “Uh…er…yes…indeed…so delighted to make your acquaintance…” Dee murmured, caught off-guard by the charm offensive. “But, er…”

        Sybil had picked up the code. Vimes loathed the word “duchess,” so if he was using it then he wanted her to out-dutch everyone. She enveloped Dee’s pointy head in delighted Duchessness.

        “Mister Dee, Sam has told me so much about you!” she trilled. “I understand you’re quite the right-hand man—”

        “—dwarf—” hissed Vimes.

        “—dwarf to his majesty! Please, you must tell how you have achieved such a delightful lighting effect here!”

        “Er…lots of candles…” Dee muttered, glaring at Vimes.

        “I think Dee wishes to discuss some political matters with me, dear,” said Vimes smoothly, putting his hand on the dwarf’s shoulder. “If you’ll just take the others down, I’ll join you shortly, I’m sure.” And he knew that no power in the world was going to prevent Sybil sweeping on down to the reception. That woman could sweep. Things stayed swept after she’d gone past.

        “You brought a troll, you brought a troll!” muttered Dee.

        “And he’s an Ankh-Morpork citizen, remember,” said Vimes. **“Covered by diplomatic immunity and a rather bad suit.”**

        “Even so—”

        “There is no ‘even so,’” said Vimes.

        “We are at war with the trolls!”

        “Well, that’s what diplomacy is all about, isn’t it?” said Vimes. “A way to stop being at war? Anyway, I understand it’s been going on for five hundred years, so obviously no one is trying very hard.”

    The Truth:

        quote: |
          “Gangvay, gangvay, please!”

          Otto pushed his way through the onlookers, struggling under the weight of a device the size and general shape of an accordion. He elbowed his way to the front of the crowd, balanced the device on its tripod, and aimed it towards a golem who was climbing out of a smoking window holding a small child.

          **“All right, boys, zis is zer big vun!”** he said, and raised the flash cage. “Vun, two, thre—aarghaarghaarghaargh…”

          The vampire became a cloud of gently settling dust. For a moment something hovered in the air. It looked like a small jar on a necklace made of string.

          Then it fell and smashed on the cobbles.

          The dust mushroomed up, took on a shape…and Otto stood blinking and running his hands over himself to check that he was all there. He caught sight of William and gave him the kind of big broad smile that only a vampire can give.

          “Mister Villiam! It vorked, your idea!”

          “Er…which one?” said William. A thin plume of yellow smoke was creeping out from under the lid of the big iconograph.

          “You said carry a little drop of emergency b-word,” said Otto. “Zo I thought: if it is in a little bottle around my neck, zen if I crumble to dust, hoopla! It vill crash and smash unt here I am!”

          He lifted the lid of the iconograph and waved the smoke away. There was the sound of very small coughing from within. “And if I am not mistaken, ve have a successfully etched picture! All of vhich only goes to show vot ve can achieve when our brains are not clouded by thoughts of open vindows and bare necks, vhich never cross my mind at all zese days because I am completely beetotal.”

          Otto had made changes to his clothing. Away had gone the traditional black evening dress preferred by his species, to be replaced by an armless vest containing more pockets than William had ever seen on one garment. Many of them were stuffed with packets of imp food, extra paint, mysterious tools, and other essentials of the iconographer’s art.

          In deference to tradition, though, Otto had made it black, with a red silk lining, and added tails.

          On making gentle inquiries of a family watching disconsolately as the smoke from the fire was turned to steam, William ascertained that the blaze had been mysteriously caused by mysterious spontaneous combustion in an overflowing mysterious chip pan full of boiling fat.

          William left them picking through the blackened remains of their home.

          “And it’s just a story,” he said, putting the notebook away. “It does makes me feel a bit of a vampire—oh…sorry.”

          “It is okay,” said Otto. “I understand. And I should like to thank you for givink me zis job. It means a lot to me, especially since I can see how nervous you are. Vhich is understandable, of course.”

          “I’m not nervous! I’m very much at home with other species!” said William hotly.

          Otto’s expression was amicable, but it was also as penetrative as the smile of a vampire can be.

          “Yes, I notice how careful you are to be friendly with the dwarfs and you are kind to me, also. It is a big effort vhich is very commendable—”

          William opened his mouth to protest, and gave up. “All right, look, it’s the way I was brought up, all right? My father was definitely very…in favor of humanity, well, ha, not humanity in the sense of…I mean, it was more that he was against—”

          “Yes, yes, I understand.”

          “And that’s all there is to it, okay? We can all decide who we’re going to be!”

          “Yes, yes, sure. And if you vant any advice about vimmin, you only have to ask.”

          “Why should I want advice about vi—women?”

          “Oh, no reason. No reason at all,” said Otto innocently.

          “Anyway, you’re a vampire. **What advice could a vampire give me about women?**”

          “Oh, my vord, vake up and smell zer garlic! Oh, zer stories I could tell you”—Otto paused—“but I von’t because I don’t do zat sort of thing anymore, now zat I have seen the daylight.” He nudged William, who was red with embarrassment. “Let us just say, zey don’t alvays scream.”

          “That’s a bit tasteless, isn’t it?”

          “Oh, that vas in zer bad old days,” said Otto hurriedly. “Now I like nothing better than a nice mug of cocoa and a good singsong around zer harmonium, I assure you. Oh, yes. My vord.”

          Sacharissa had pulled herself together, perhaps because no one was trying to comfort her anymore.

          “But what happens if those men come back?”

          “I don’t think they will. This place is being watched now.”

          Sacharissa started to pick papers up off the floor. “I suppose I’ll feel better if I do something…”

Even zer pale ladies viz the velvet basques vorn on zer outside and zer fetching black lace dresses and zose little tiny, you know, high-heeled boots, and zat vas a wrench, I don’t mind telling you…” He shook his head miserably, and stared at his ruined shirt. “And stuff all gets broken and now my best shirt is all covered viz…blood…covered viz red, red blood…rich dark blood…zer blood…covered with zer blood…zer blood…”

          “Quick!” said Sacharissa, pushing past William. “Mister Goodmountain, you hold his arms!” She waved at the dwarfs. “I was ready for this! Two of you hold his legs! Dozy, there’s a huge blutwurst in my desk drawer!”

          **“…Let me valk in sunshine, living not in vein…”** Otto crooned.

          “Oh, my gods, his eyes are glowing red!” said William. “What shall we do?”

          “We could try cutting his head off again?” said Boddony.

          “That was a very poor joke, Boddony,” Sacharissa snapped.

          “Joke? I was smiling?”

          Otto stood up, the cursing dwarfs hanging off his sparse frame.

          “Through thunderstorm and dreadful night, ve will carry on zer fight…”

          “He’s as strong as an ox!” said Goodmountain.

          “Hang on, maybe it would help if we joined in!” said Sacharissa. She fumbled in her bag and produced a slim blue pamphlet. “I picked this up this morning, from the mission in Abattoirs Lane. It’s their songbook! And”—she started to sniff again—“it’s so sad, it’s called ‘Walking in Sunshine’ and it’s so—”

          “You want us to have a singsong?” said Goodmountain, as the struggling Otto lifted him off the ground.

          “Just to give him moral support!” Sacharissa dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief. “You can see he’s trying to fight it! And he did lay down his life for us!”

          “Yes, but then he picked it up again!”

    Thief of Time:
      - |
        Death found Famine in a restaurant in Genua. He had a booth all to himself and was eating Duck and Dirty Rice.

        “Oh,” said Famine. “It’s you.”

        YES. WE MUST RIDE. YOU MUST HAVE GOT MY MESSAGE.

        “Pull up a chair,” Famine hissed. “They do a very good alligator sausage here.”

        I SAID, WE MUST RIDE.

        “Why?”

        Death sat down and explained. Famine listened, although he never stopped eating.

        “I see,” he said at last. “Thank you, but **I think I shall sit this one out.**”

        SIT IT OUT? YOU’RE A HORSEMAN!

        “Yes, of course. But what is my role here?”

        I BEG YOUR PARDON?

        “No famine appears to be involved, does it? A shortage of food per se? As such?”

        WELL, NO. NOT AS SUCH, OBVIOUSLY, BUT—

        “So I would, as it were, be turning up just to wave. No, thank you.”

        YOU USED TO RIDE OUT EVERY TIME, said Death accusingly.

        Famine waved a bone airily. “We had proper apocalypses in those days,” he said and sucked at the bone. “You could sink your teeth into them.”

        NEVERTHELESS, THIS IS THE END OF THE WORLD.

        Famine pushed his plate aside and opened the menu.

        “There are other worlds,” he said. “You’re too sentimental, Death. I’ve always said so.”

        Death drew himself up. Humans had created Famine, too. Oh, there had always been droughts and locusts, but for a really good famine, for fertile land to be turned into a dust bowl by stupidity and avarice, you needed humans. Famine was arrogant.

        I AM SORRY, Death said, TO HAVE TRESPASSED ON YOUR TIME.

        “I really don’t know why I listen to you, Lu-Tze, I really don’t,” said Qu. He glanced at the arena and hurriedly raised his megaphone to his lips. “Don’t hold it that way up! I said don’t hold—”

        There was a thunderclap. Lu-Tze didn’t bother to turn around.

        Qu lifted the megaphone again and said wearily, “All right, someone please go and fetch Brother Kai, will you? Start looking around, oh, two centuries ago. You don’t even use these very useful devices I, er, devise,” he added to Lu-Tze.

        “Don’t need to,” said Lu-Tze. “Got a brain. Anyway, I use the temporal toilet, don’t I?”

        “**A privy that discharges ten million years into the past was not a good idea, Sweeper.** I’m sorry I let you persuade me.”

        “It’s saving us fourpence a week to Harry King’s bucket boys, Qu, and that’s not to be sneezed at. Is it not written, ‘A penny saved is a penny earned?’ Besides, it all lands in a volcano anyway. Perfectly hygienic.”

        “For the sake of precision,” said Dr. Lawn, “let us say she’s a needlewoman. Apparently she heard there was a lot of work for seamstresses in the big city and had one or two amusing misunderstandings before someone told her exactly what was meant. One of them involved me removing a crochet hook from a man’s ear last week. Now she just hangs out with the rest of the girls.”

        “Why?”

        “Because she’s making a fortune, that’s why. Hasn’t it ever occurred to you, sergeant, that sometimes people go to a massage parlor for a real massage, for example? There’s ladies all over this city with discreet signs up that say things like ‘Trousers repaired while you wait,’ and a small but significant number of men make the same mistake as Sandra. There’s lot of men work here in the city and leave their wives back home and **sometimes, you know, a man feels these…urges. Like, for a sock without holes and a shirt with more than one button.** The ladies pass on the work. Apparently it’s quite hard to find a really good needlewoman in this city.

        quote: |
          “It’th me, thur,” said Constable Igor, pushing his head around the door, and then he added, “Igor, sir.”

          “Yes, Igor?” said Vimes, wondering not for the first time why anyone with stitches all around his head needed to tell anyone who he was. - The Igor employed by the Watch as forensic specialist and medical aide was quite young (insofar as you could tell with an Igor, since useful limbs and other organs were passed on among Igors as others might hand down a pocket watch) and very modern in his thinking. He had a DA haircut with extended quiff, wore crepe soles, and sometimes forgot to lisp.

          “I would just like to thay, sir, that I could have got young Thronginthearm back on his feet, thur,” said Igor, a shade reproachfully.

          Vimes sighed. Igor’s face was full of concern tinged with disappointment. He had been prevented from plying his…craft. He was naturally disappointed.

          “We’ve been through this, Igor. It’s not like sewing a leg back on. And dwarfs are dead set against that sort of thing.”

          “There’s nothing thupernatural about it, thur. I am a man of Natural Philothophy! And he was still warm when they brought him in—”

          “Those are the rules, Igor. Thanks all the same. We know your heart is in the right place—”

          “They are in the right places, sir,” said Igor reproachfully.

          “That’s what I meant,” Vimes said without missing a beat, just as Igor never did.

          “Oh, very well, sir,” said Igor, giving up. He paused, and then said: “How is her ladyship, sir?”

          Vimes had been expecting this. It was a terrible thing for a mind to do, but his had already presented him with the idea of Igor and Sybil in the same sentence. Not that he disliked Igor. Quite the reverse. There were watchmen walking around the streets right now who wouldn’t have legs if it wasn’t for Igor’s genius with a needle. But—

          “Fine. She’s fine,” he said abruptly.

          “Only I heard that Mrs. Content was a bit worr—”

          “Igor, there are some areas where…look, do you know anything about…women and babies?”

          “Not in so many wordth, sir, but I find that once I’ve got someone on the slab and had a good, you know, **rummage around**, I can thort out most thingth—”

          Vimes’s imagination actually shut down at this point.

          “Thank you, Igor,” he managed without his voice trembling, “but Mrs. Content is a very experienced midwife.”

          “Jutht as you say, sir,” said Igor, but doubt rode on the words.

        Carcer had retreated to the side of the street, his men—far fewer men—with him.

        Colon was on his knees, throwing up. Dickins was down, and Vimes knew he was dead. Nobby was down, too, but that was just because someone had kicked him hard and he’d probably decided that staying down was best. There were a lot of Carcer’s men down, more than half. Some more had fled a maniac with two swords. Some had even fled Reg Shoe, who was sitting on the barricade, staring at the sheer weight of arrows in him. As he watched, his brain evidently decided that he must be dead on this evidence, and he fell backward. But in a few hours, his brain would be in for a surprise.

        No one knew why some people became **natural zombies**, substituting sheer stubborn willpower for blind life force. But attitude played a part. For Reg Shoe, life was only just beginning…

        Polly hesitated.

        “Um…is it obvious?” she said.

        “No. That’s why I gave you the socks.”

        “I meant that…that I’m not…that I’m…”

        “Not really,” said the voice in the dark. “You’re pretty good. You come over as a frightened young lad trying to look big and brave. You might pick your nose a bit more often. Just a tip. Few things interest a young man more than the **contents of his nostrils**.

        “I want to speak to your officer, damn you,” said the captain, who looked a little less unfocused now. “You do have an officer, don’t you?”

        “Yeah, we’ve got one somewhere, as I recall,” said Jackrum. “Perks, go and fetch the rupert, will you? Best if you take that dress off first, too. **You never know, with ruperts.**”

      - |
        When she came off guard for a bowl of game casserole, Jackrum was teaching basic sword craft to Lofty and Tonker, using hazel sticks as swords. By the time Polly had finished, he was teaching Wazzer some of the finer points of using a high-performance pistol crossbow, especially the one about not turning around with it cocked and saying “w-what is this bit for, Sarge?” Wazzer handled weapons like a houseproud woman disposing of a dead mouse—at arm’s length and trying not to look. But even she was better with them than Igor, who just didn’t seem at home with the idea of what was, to him, **randomized surgery**.

      - His rabbitty features looked unusually determined, **as if a hamster had spotted a gap in its treadmill.**

      - |
        “Lips sealed, sir!” said Jackrum. “You can leave it all to me, sir! Captain Blouse’s squad, attention! You will obtain uniforms! You can’t go around still dressed as washerwomen, oh dear me!”

        “We are soldiers?” said Polly.

        “O’course you are, otherwise I wouldn’t be shoutin’ at you, **you ’orrible little woman!** The world’s turned upside down! It’s a bit more important than you right now, eh? You’ve got what you’re after, right? Now get hold of a uniform, find yourself a shako, and wipe your face, at least. You are taking the official truce to the enemy.”

        “Um…” said Igorina, “we’re quite close, I think. I can see a sign. Um…it’s at the end of this passage. Um…just behind those rather puzzled armed men with the, um …efficient-looking crossbows. Um. I think what you’ve just been saying was important and **needed to be said. Only, um…not just now, perhaps? And not so loudly?**”

        Miss Level began to look hunted herself. Fifty small faces, full of worry and hope and broken noses, looked up at her. And she knew she didn’t have a better plan. Or even a PLN.

        “All right,” she said. “But at least **you ought to have a bath**. I know that’s silly, but it will make me feel better about the whole thing.”

        There was a general groan.

        “A bath? But we a’ had one no’ a year ago,” said Rob Anybody. “Up at the big dew pond for the ships!”

        “Ach, crivens!” said Big Yan. “Ye canna ask a man tae take a bath again this soon, mistress! There’ll be nothin’ left o’ us!”

        “With hot water and soap!” said Miss Level. “I mean it! I’ll run the water and I…I’ll put some rope over the edge so you can climb in and out, but you will get clean. I’m a wi—a hag, and you’d better do what I say!”

      - |
        “Could I no’ mebbe just learn the writin’ and leave the readin’ to someone else?” Rob asked, without much hope.

        “No, my man’s got to do both,” said Jeannie, folding her arms. When a female Feegle does that, there’s no hope left.

        “Ach, it’s a **terrible thing for a man when his wumman gangs up on him wi’ a toad**,” said Rob, shaking his head. But when he turned to look at the grubby paper, there was just a hint of pride in his face.

        “Er…you don’t think you ought to think about this, do you?” said Tiffany.

        Mr. Weavall laughed. “Think? I got no business to be thinking about it, young lady! Who’re you to tell an old ’un like I that he ought to be thinking? I’m ninety-one, I am! Got to be up and doing! Besides, I have reason to believe by the twinkle in her eye that the Widow Tussy will not turn up her nose at my suggestion.

        “Rob!”

        Hamish and Big Yan came tumbling through the fake rabbit hole that was the entrance to the mound.

        Rob Anybody glared at them. “We wuz engaged in a lit’try enterprise,” he said.

        “Yes, Rob, but we watched the big wee young hag safe awa’, like you said, but there’s a hiver after her!” Hamish blurted out.

        “Are ye sure?” said Rob, dropping his pencil. “I never heard o’ one of them in this world!”

        “Oh, aye,” said Big Yan. “Its buzzin’ fair made my teeths ache!”

        “So did you no’ tell her, ye daftie?” said Rob.

        “There’s that other hag wi’ her, Rob,” said Big Yan. “The educatin’ hag.”

        “Miss Tick?” said the toad.

        “Aye, the one wi’ a face like a yard o’ yogurt,” said Big Yan. “An’ you said we wuzna’ to show ourselves, Rob.”

        “Aye, weel, this is different—” Rob Anybody began, but stopped.

        He hadn’t been a husband for very long, but upon marriage **men get a whole lot of extra senses** bolted into their brain, and one is there to tell a man that he’s suddenly neck deep in real trouble.

        STANLEY POLISHED his pins. He did so with a look of beatific concentration, like a man dreaming with his eyes open.

        The collection sparkled on the folded strips of brown paper and the rolls of black felt that made up the landscape of the true pinhead’s world. Beside him was his large desktop magnifying glass and, by his feet, a sack of miscellaneous pins bought last week from a retiring needlewoman.

        He was putting off the moment of opening it, to savor it all the more. Of course, it’d almost certainly turn out to be full of everyday brassers, with maybe the occasional flathead or line flaw, but the thing was, you never knew. That was **the joy of sacks.** You never knew. Noncollectors were woefully unconcerned about pins, treating them as if they were no more that thin, pointy bits of metal for sticking things to other things. Many a wonderful pin of great worth had been found in a sack of brassers.

        And now he had a No. 3 Broad-headed “Chicken” Extra Long, thanks to kind Mr. Lipwig. The world shone like the pins so neatly ranged on the felt rolled out in front of him. He might smell faintly of cheese, and have athlete’s foot extending to the knee, but just now Stanley soared through glittering skies on wings of silver.

          MUSTRUM RIDCULLY, Archchancellor of Unseen University, leveled his cue and took careful aim.

          The white ball hit a red ball, which rolled gently into a pocket. This was harder than it looked, because more than half of the snooker table served as the Archchancellor’s filing system, - Ridcully practiced the First Available Surface method of filing. - and, indeed, to get to the hole the ball had to pass through several piles of paperwork, a tankard, a skull with a dribbly candle on it, and a lot of pipe ash. It did so.

          “Well done, Mr. Stibbons,” said Ridcully.

          “I call it baize-space,” said Ponder Stibbons proudly.

          Every organization needs at least one person who knows what’s going on and why it’s happening and who’s doing it, and at UU this role was filled by Stibbons, who often wished it wasn’t. Right now he was present in his position as head of Inadvisably Applied Magic, and his long-term purpose was to see that his department’s budget went through on the nod. To this end, therefore, a bundle of thick pipes led from under the heavy old billiard table, out through a hole in the wall and across the lawn, and into the High Energy Magic building, where—he sighed—this little trick was taking up forty percent of the rune-time of Hex, the university’s thinking engine.

          “Good name,” said Ridcully, lining up another shot.

          “As in phase space?” said Ponder hopefully. “When a ball is just about to encounter an obstacle that is not another ball, you see, Hex moves it into a theoretical parallel dimension where there is unoccupied flat surface, and maintains speed and drag until it can be brought back to this one. It really is a most difficult and intricate piece of unreal-time spell-casting—”

          “Yes, yes, very good,” said Ridcully. “Was there something else, Mr. Stibbons?”

          Ponder looked at his clipboard. “There’s a polite letter from Lord Vetinari asking on behalf of the city whether the university might consider including in its intake, oh, twenty-five percent of less able students, sir?”

          Ridcully potted the black through a heap of university directives.

          “Can’t have a bunch of grocers and butchers telling a university how to run itself, Stibbons!” he said firmly, lining up on a red. “Thank them for their interest and tell them we’ll continue to take one hundred percent of complete and utter dullards, as usual. Take ’em in dull, turn ’em out sparklin’, that’s always been the UU way! Anythin’ else?”

          “Just this message for the big race tonight, Archchancellor.”

          “Oh, yes, that thing. What should I do, Mr. Stibbons? I hear there’s heavy betting on the Post Office.”

          “Yes, Archchancellor. People say the gods are on the side of Mr. Lipwig.”

          “Are they betting?” said Ridcully, watching with satisfaction as the ball rematerialized on the other side of a **neglected ham sandwich.**

          The Archchancellor paused, and his big face screwed up in thought.

          “Haruspex’s Directory of Varying Dimensions,” he said at last.

          “Pardon, Archchancellor?”

          “That’s the message,” said Ridcully. “No one said it had to be a letter, eh?” He waved a hand over the tip of the cue, which grew a powdering of fresh chalk. “Give them each a copy of the new edition. Send ’em to our man in Genua…what’s his name, thingummy, got a funny name…show him the old Alma Pater is thinkin’ of him.”

          “That’s Devious H. Collabone, sir. He’s studying Oyster Communications in a Low Intensity Magical Field for his B. Thau.”

          “Good gods, can they communicate?” said Ridcully.

          “Apparently, Archchancellor, although thus far they’re refusing to talk to him.”

          “Why’d we send him all the way out there?”

          “Devious Collabone, Archchancellor?” Ponder prompted. “Remember? With the terrible halitosis?”

          “Oh, **you mean Dragonbreath** Collabone?” said Ridcully, as realization dawned. “The one who could blow a hole in a silver plate?”

          “Yes, Archchancellor,” said Ponder patiently. Mustrum Ridcully always liked to triangulate in on new information from several positions. “You said that out in the swamps no one would notice? If you remember, we allowed him to take a small omniscope.”

          “Did we? Far-thinking of us. Call him up right now and tell him what’s going on, will you?”

          “Yes, Archchancellor. In fact, I’ll leave it a few hours, because it’s still nighttime in Genua.”

          “That’s only their opinion,” said Ridcully, sighting again. “Do it now, man.”

          The Archchancellor put his arm around Moist’s shoulders and led him around the coach. Then he leaned down until their faces were a few inches apart.

          “You are aware, are you, that painting a few stars on **a perfectly ordinary broomstick** doesn’t mean it will get airborne?” he said.

          Moist looked into a pair of milky-blue eyes that were as innocent as a child’s, particularly a child who is trying hard to look innocent.

          “My goodness, doesn’t it?” he said.

        “It is the principle of the thing, Mr. Lipwig,” said the woman firmly. “Anyone called Mister is not allowed in the ladies’. That sort of thing can only lead to **hanky-panky**. I will not stand for it, Mr. Lipwig.”

        Moist stared at her. Then he looked up at Mr. Pump, who was never far away.

        “Mr. Pump, is there any reason why one of the golems can’t have a new name?” he asked. “In the interest of hanky-panky avoidance?”

        “No, Mr. Lipvig,” the golem rumbled.

        Moist turned back to Miss Maccalariat. “Would ‘Gladys’ do, Miss Maccalariat?”

        “‘Gladys’ will be sufficient, Mr. Lipwig,” said Miss Maccalariat, more than a hint of triumph in her voice. “She must be properly clothed, of course.”

        “Clothed?” said Moist weakly. “But a golem isn’t—it doesn’t—they don’t have…” He quailed under the glare, and gave up. “Yes, Miss Maccalariat. Something gingham, I think, Mr. Pump?”

        “I Shall Arrange It, Postmaster,” said the golem.

        “Ah, Mr. Lipwig,” said Lord Vetinari, looking up. “Thank you so much for dropping in. It has been such a busy day, has it not? Drumknott, do help Mr. Lipwig to a chair. Prophecy can be very exhausting, I believe.”

        Moist waved the clerk away and eased his aching body into a seat.

        “I didn’t exactly decide to drop in,” he said. “A large troll watchman walked in and grabbed me by the arm.”

        “Ah, to steady you, I have no doubt,” said Lord Vetinari, who was poring over the battle between the stone trolls and the stone dwarfs. “You accompanied him of your own free will, did you not?”

        “**I’m very attached to my arm**,” said Moist. “I thought I’d better follow it. What can I do for you, my lord?”

        Vetinari got up and went and sat in the chair behind his desk, where he regarded Moist with what almost looked like amusement.

        “We’ve got no room for passengers in the Watch,” he said. “We’re too pressed right now to give you any more than what is laughingly known as on-the-job training, but you’ll be on the streets from day one…er, how are you with the daylight thing?”

        “I’m fine with long sleeves and a wide brim. I carry the kit, anyway.”

        Vimes nodded. A small dustpan and brush, a vial of animal blood, and a small card saying:


        Help, I have crumbled and I can’t get up. Please sweep me into a heap and crush vial. **I am a Black Ribboner** and will not harm you. Thanking you in advance.

        “I think you need to get some sleep yourself, Commander,” said Carrot. “And technically, it isn’t Koom Valley until Saturday.”

        “Of course, monuments to battles that didn’t take place might be stretching things a bit, but a stamp—”

        “Lady Sybil really worries about you, sir.” Carrot broadcast concern.

        The fizz in Vimes’s head subsided. As if awakened by the reference to Sybil, the debtors of his body queued up to wave their overdue IOUs: feet—dead tired and in need of a bath; stomach—gurgling; ribs—on fire; back—aching; brain—drunk on its own poisons. Bath, sleep, eat…good ideas. But still must do things…

        “How’s our Mr. Pessimal?” he said.

        “Igor’s fixed him up, sir. He’s a bit amazed at all the fuss. Now, I know I can’t order you to go and see his lordship—”

        “No, you can’t, because I am a commander, Captain,” said Vimes, still fuzzily intoxicated on exhaustion.

        “—but he can and he has, sir. And your coach will be waiting for you outside the palace when you come out. That’s Lady Sybil’s orders, sir,” said Carrot, appealing to higher authority.

        Vimes looked up at the ugly bulk of the palace. Suddenly, clean sheets seemed such a sweet idea.

        “Can’t face him like this,” he murmured.

        “I had a word with Secretary Drumknott, sir. Hot water, a razor, and a big cup of coffee will be waiting in the palace.”

        “You thought of everything, Carrot…”

        “I hope so, sir. Now off you—”

        “But I thought of something, eh?” said Vimes, swaying cheerfully. “Better dead drunk than just dead, eh?”

        “It was a classic ruse, sir,” said Carrot reassuringly. “One for the history books. Now, off you go, sir. I’m going to have a look for Angua. She hasn’t slept in her bed.”

        “But **at this time of the month**—”

        “I know, sir. She hasn’t slept in her basket, either.”

      - |
        “What?” said Angua, reading the menu, “is a **Screaming Orgasm**?”

        “Ah,” said Sally, “Looks like we got to you just in time, girl!”

        “No,” sighed Angua as the others laughed; that was such a vampire response. “I mean what’s it made of?’’

        “Almonté, Wahlulu, Bearhuggers Whiskey Cream, and vodka,” said Tawneee, who knew the recipe for every cocktail ever made.

        “And how does it work?” said Cheery, craning to see over the top of the bar.

        Sally ordered four, and turned back to Tawneee.

      - |
        “Breakfast, Sam!” called Sybil, from the doorway. A nasty suspicion gripped Vimes, and he hurried over to the other coach, where Carrot was strapping on the last bag.

        “Who packed the food? Did Sybil pack the food?” he said.

        “I think so, sir.”

        “Was there…fruit?” said Vimes, **probing the horror.**

        “I believe so, sir. Quite a lot. And vegetables.”

        “Some bacon, surely?” Vimes was nearly begging. “Very good for a long journey, bacon. It travels well.”

        He turned his head, wincing at the stab of pain, and saw a small but brightly lit folding chair on the sand. A robed figure was reclining in it, reading a book. A scythe was stuck in the sand beside it.

        A white, skeletal hand turned a page.

        “You’ll be Death, then?” said Vimes, after a while.

        AH, MISTER VIMES, ASTUTE AS EVER. GOT IT IN ONE, said Death, shutting the book on his finger to keep the place.

        “I’ve seen you before.”

        I HAVE WALKED WITH YOU MANY TIMES, MISTER VIMES.

        “And this is it, is it?”

        HAS IT NEVER STRUCK YOU THAT THE CONCEPT OF A WRIT-TEN NARRATIVE IS SOMEWHAT STRANGE? said Death.

        Vimes could tell when people were trying to avoid something they really didn’t want to say, and it was happening here.

        “Is it?” he insisted. “Is this it? This time I die?”

        COULD BE.

        “Could be? What sort of answer is that?” said Vimes.

        A VERY ACCURATE ONE. YOU SEE, YOU ARE HAVING A NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE, WHICH INESCAPABLY MEANS THAT I MUST UNDERGO A **NEAR-VIMES EXPERIENCE**. DON’T MINDME. CARRY ON WITH WHATEVER YOU WERE DOING. I HAVE A BOOK.

        “Is there anything to eat?” he said. It wasn’t the most awe-inspired thing to say, but it came from the stomach, with feeling.

        “Our rations got lost in the excitement, sir. But the dwarfs will share theirs. They aren’t unfriendly, sir. Just cautious.”

        “Share? They have dwarf bread?”

        “I’m afraid so, sir.”

        “I thought it was **illegal to give that to prisoners.** I think I’ll wait, thanks. And now, Sergeant, you can tell me about the excitement.”

        “When a bull coo meets a lady coo, he disna have tae say, ‘My heart goes bang-bang-bang when I see your wee face,’ ’cuz it’s kinda built intae their heads. People have it more difficult.

        Tiffany glanced at the sky, and Nanny was the kind of inconvenient person who notices everything.

        “Wondering if lover boy is goin’ to drop in?” she said with a big grin.

        “Nanny! Really!”

        “But you are, aren’t you?” said Nanny, who knew no shame. “O’ course, he’s always around, when you think about it. You’re walking through him, you feel him on your skin, you stamp him off your boots when you go indoors—”

    Making money:
      - |
        “Well, I…well, I suppose I do,” he managed. “I know if you want to sell the sausage you have to know how to sell the sizzle.”

        “Well and good, well and good,” said Topsy, “but I hope you know that however gifted you are as a sizzle salesman, sooner or later you must be able to **produce the sausage**, hmm?” She gave him a wink which would have got a younger woman jailed.

      - |
        Bent sighed. “You express yourself colorfully, Mr. Lipwig, but I suppose there is some truth there. It didn’t work, anyway. Then it got used as storage in case of siege, became an indoor market, and so on, and then Jocatello La Vice got the place when the city defaulted on a loan. It is all in the official history. **Isn’t the fornication wonderful?**”

        After quite a lengthy pause, Moist ventured: “Is it?”

        “Don’t you think so? There’s more here than anywhere else in the city, I’m told.”

        “Really?” said Moist, looking around nervously. “Er…do you have to come down here at some special time?”

        “Well, during banking hours usually, but we let groups in by appointment.”

        “You know,” said Moist, “I think this conversation has somehow got away from me…”

        Bent waved vaguely at the ceiling.

        “I refer to the wonderful vaulting,” he said. “The word derives from fornix, meaning ‘arch.’”

        “Ah! Yes? Right!” said Moist. “You know, I wouldn’t be surprised if not many people knew that.”

        Then there was the excitement of Brassica World, where very small children could burst into terrified screams at the huge head of Captain Cabbage himself, along with his friends Cauliflower the Clown and Billy Broccoli. For older visitors there was, of course, the Cabbage Research Institute, over which a green pall always hung and downwind of which plants tended to be rather strange and sometimes turned to watch you as you passed.

          “Show me…show me what happens when people get fed up with banks,” he said.

          “Ah, yes, a familiar one! Igor, set up program five!” Hubert shouted to some figure in the forest of glassware. There was the sound of squeaky screws being turned and the glug of reservoirs being topped up.

          “Igor?” said Moist. “You have an Igor?”

          “Oh, yes,” said Hubert. “That’s how I get this wonderful light. They know the secret of storing lightning in jars! But don’t let that worry you, Mr. Lipspick. Just because I’m employing an Igor and working in a cellar doesn’t mean I am some sort of **madman**, ha ha ha!”

          “Ha ha,” agreed Moist.

          “Ha hah hah!” said Hubert. “Hahahahahaha!! Ahahahahaha hhhhh!!!!!—”

          Bent slapped him on the back. Hubert coughed. “Sorry about that, it’s the air down here,” he mumbled.

        quote: |
          Something akin to a workshop had been built on the end wall of the undercroft, around a huge and ancient fireplace. An Igor was working over an intense, blue-white flame, carefully bending a piece of glass pipe. Behind him, green liquid surged and fizzed in giant bottles: Igors seemed to have a natural affinity with lightning.

          You could always recognize an Igor. They went out of their way to be recognized. It wasn’t just the musty dusty old suits, or even the occasional extra digit or mismatched eyes. It was that you could probably stand a ball on the top of their head without it falling off.

          The Igor looked up.

          “Good morning, thur. And you are…?”

          “Moist von Lipwig,” said Moist. “And you would be Igor.”

          “Got it in one, thur. I have heard many good thingth about you.”

          “Down here?”

          “I alwayth keep an ear to the ground, thur.”

          Moist resisted the impulse to look down. Igors and metaphors didn’t go well together.

          “Well, Igor…the thing is…I want to bring someone into the building without troubling the guards, and I wonder if there was another door down here?”

          What he did not say, but what passed between them on the ether, was: You’re an Igor, right? And when the mob are sharpening their sickles and trying to break down the door, the Igor is never there. Igors were masters of the unobtrusive exit.

          “There ith a thmall door we ueth, thur. It can’t be opened from the outthide tho itth never guarded.”

          Moist looked longingly at the rainwear on its stand.

          “Fine. Fine. I’m just popping out, then.”

          “You’re the bothth, thur.”

          “And I shall be popping back shortly with a man. Er…a gentleman who is not anxious to meet civic authority.”

          “Quite, thur. **Give them a pitchfork** and they think they own the bloody plathe, thur.”

          “But he’s not a murderer or anything.”

          “I’m an Igor, thur. We don’t athk quethtionth.”

          “Really? Why not?”

          “I don’t know, thur. I didn’t athk.”

        He looked nervously at the little man. He wasn’t insane, Moist was sure, but it was clear that mostly, for him, **the world happened elsewhere.**

        “Sorry about that, I have two left feet sometimes. Could you both just chant a bit while I do the mystic waving, please? Don’t worry about words. Anything seems to work if it sounds sepulchral enough.”

        As he walked around the circle, chanting variants on oo! and raah!, Moist wondered how many bankers raised the dead during the course of an afternoon. Probably not a high number. He shouldn’t be doing this, surely. He should be out there making money. Owls—Clamp must have finished the design by now. He could be holding his first note in his hands by tomorrow! And then there was damn Cribbins, who could be talking to anyone. True, the man had a rap sheet as long as a roller towel, but the city worked by alliances and if he met up with the Lavishes then Moist’s life would unravel all the way back to the gallows—

        “In my day we at least hired a decent mask,” growled an elderly voice. “I say, is that a woman over there?”

        A figure had appeared in the circle, without any bother or fuss, apart from the grumbling. It was in every respect the picture of a wizard—robed, pointy-hatted, bearded, and elderly, with the addition of a silvery monochrome effect overall and some slight transparency.

        “Ah, Professor Flead,” said Hicks, “it’s kind of you to join us…”

        “You know you brought me here and it’s not as if I had anything else to do,” said Flead. He turned back to Adora Belle and his voice became pure syrup. “What is your name, my dear?”

        “Adora Belle Dearheart.”

        The warning tone of voice was lost on Flead.

        “How delightful,” he said, giving her a gummy smile. Regrettably, this made little strings of saliva vibrate in his mouth like the web of a very old spider. “And would you believe me if I told you that you bear a striking resemblance to **my beloved concubine** Fenti, who died more than three hundred years ago? The likeness is astounding!”

        “I’d say that was a pickup line,” said Adora Belle.

        “Oh dear, such cynicism,” sighed the late Flead, turning to the Head of Postmortem Communications.

        “Apart from this young lady’s wonderful chanting, it was frankly a mess, Hicks,” he said sharply. He tried to pat Adora Belle’s hand, but his fingers passed right through.

        “I’m sorry, professor, we just don’t get the funding these days,” said Hicks.

      - |
        “Necromancy is a fine art?” said Moist.

        “None finer, young man. Get things just a tiny bit wrong and the spirits of the vengeful dead may enter your head via your ears and blow your brains out down your nose.”

        The eyes of Moist and Adora Belle focused on Dr. Hicks like those of an archer on his target. He waved his hands frantically and mouthed “Not very often!”

        “What is a pretty young woman like you doing here, hmm?” said Flead, trying to grab Adora Belle’s hand again.

        “I’m trying to translate a phrase from Umnian,” she said, giving him a wooden smile and absentmindedly wiping her hand on her dress.

        “Are women allowed to do that sort of thing these days? What fun! One of my greatest regrets, you know, is that when I was in possession of a body I didn’t let it spend enough time in the company of young ladies…”

        Moist looked around to see if there was any kind of emergency lever. There had to be something, if only in the event of nasal brain explosion.

        He sidled up to Hicks.

        “It’s going to go really bad in a moment!” he hissed.

        “It’s all right, I can banish him to the Undead Zone in a moment,” Hicks whispered.

        “That won’t be far enough if she loses her temper! I once saw her put a stiletto heel right through a man’s foot while she was smoking a cigarette. **She hasn’t had a cigarette for more than fifteen minutes, so there’s no telling what she’ll do!**”

      - |
        Vetinari opened his eyes. “Miss Dearheart, always a pleasure,” he murmured, waving away the smoke. “I thought you were gone. Imagine my delight at finding you are not.”

        “Well, did you?” said Adora Belle, her cigarette noticeably shortening as she took another drag. **She smoked as if it were a kind of warfare.**

      - |
        The coach door was opened, and Moist and Adora Belle stepped down into the palace gardens.

        They had the usual look of such places—neat, tidy, lots of gravel and pointy trees and no vegetables.

        “Why are we here?” said Adora Belle. “It’s about the golems, isn’t it?”

        “Miss Dearheart, what do our local golems think about this new army?”

        “They don’t like them. They think they will cause trouble. They have no chem that can be changed. They’re worse than zombies.”

        “Thank you. A further question: Will they kill?”

        “Historically, golem-makers have learned not to make golems that kill—”

        “Is that a no?”

        “I don’t know!”

        “We make progress. Is it possible to give them an order which cannot be countermanded by another person?”

        “Well, er…Yes. If they don’t know the wretched secret.”

        “Which is?” Vetinari turned back to Moist and drew the sword.

        “It must be the way I give the orders, sir,” said Moist, squinting downward at the blade for the second time. It really did glint.

        He was braced for what happened, except that it happened in entirely the wrong way.

        Vetinari handed him the sword and said, “Miss Dearheart, I really wish you would not leave the city for long periods. It makes this man seek danger. Tell us the secret, Mr. Lipwig.”

        “I think it could be too dangerous, sir.”

        “Mr. Lipwig, do I need **a button that says TYRANT**?”

        “Can I make a bargain?”

        “Of course. I am a reasonable man.”

        “Will you keep to it?”

        “No. But I will make a different bargain,” said Vetinari. “The Post Office can have six golem horses. The other golem warriors will be considered wards of the Golem Trust, but the use of four hundred of them to improve the operation of the clacks system will, I am sure, meet with international approval. We will replace gold with golems as a basis for our currency, as you have so eloquently pleaded. The two of you have made the international situation very…interesting—”

        Dr. Whiteface nodded at Vetinari.

        “My lord…”

        “Dr. Whiteface,” said the Patrician. “And how is the patient?”

        “Oh, if only he had come to us when he was young,” said Whiteface, “what a clown he would have been! What timing! Oh, by the way, we do not normally allow women visitors into the Guild, but in these special circumstances we are waiving this rule.”

        “Oh, I’m so glad,” said Adora Belle, acid etching every syllable.

        “It is simply that, whatever the Jokes For Women group says, women are just not funny.”

        “It is a terrible affliction,” Adora Belle agreed.

        “An interesting dichotomy, in fact, since neither are clowns,” said Vetinari.

        “I’ve always thought so,” said Adora Belle.

        “They are tragic,” said Vetinari, “and we laugh at their tragedy as we laugh at our own. The painted grin leers out at us from the darkness, mocking our insane belief in order, logic, status, the reality of reality. The mask knows that we are born on the banana skin that leads only to the open **manhole cover of doom**, and all we can hope for are the cheers of the crowd.”

        “Where do the squeaky balloon animals fit in?” said Moist.

        “I have no idea. But I understand that when the would-be murderers broke in, Mr. Bent strangled one with quite a lifelike humorous pink elephant made out of balloons.”

        “Just imagine the noise,” said Adora Belle cheerfully.
